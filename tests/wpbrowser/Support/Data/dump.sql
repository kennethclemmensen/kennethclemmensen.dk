I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, another WordCamp Europe is in the books. We had the second-highest number of tickets sold in the history of our event series, with the first being WordCamp Europe in Berlin. But even with that number of tickets sold, that number of people gathering together to talk about WordPress and related things, there were still a lot of people who didn&#8217;t get to join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For some, that came with experiencing FOMO, but some of you embraced the JOMO of it all. Either way, at this point, there are a good collection of wrap-ups and round-ups going around, so I&#8217;m here to tell you a bit about what was buzzing in the hallway track.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, everyone was so excited to see old friends and make new ones. Everywhere I turned, I saw WordPressers in clusters catching up, most included new to the crew faces. So we know that we were using the Pac-Man rule that we love so much. But even while they were catching up on the last two, three, four years, they were also talking to each other about how to get more folks to things like this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we all generally agree that your first time meeting other WordPressers can be a truly pivotal moment in your WordPress journey, it was a delight to hear so much brainstorming focused on that. From mentorship to community introduction and the future of our events, the question of how to keep our ecosystem healthy and thriving was a big topic. Does any one of us have all the answers to this? No, but fortunately, we&#8217;ve got a global set of thinkers working on this global question. So, together, I&#8217;m sure we can come up with some good guesses to try out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Secondly, I saw a ton of talks and discussions about career development, not only about how to learn more but also how to be a champion for open source in your company, how to advocate for contribution as a best business practice. And what other communities can teach us about how they commit to their user&#8217;s continuing education, for lack of a friendlier term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And boy, do I love a good conversation about how to make working in open source easier, make it more meaningful, and more impactful. I&#8217;m in favor of anything that helps to dignify our profession. The front-facing, easy-to-use experience of WordPress, in particular, has been misunderstood to mean that we are a simple piece of software for simple tasks. And that is the way with our mission really. If we succeed at democratizing publishing or learning or commerce for that matter, we are taking the arcane and making it mundane. But simple to use doesn&#8217;t mean simple to create. And I want all of our future employers and clients to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing that I saw lighting up the hallway track was the idea of bringing life and excitement back to the web. WordPress has been fighting against closed systems for a long time, but as Matt alluded to in his keynote, merely having an open web is still not quite as fun as having an active and dynamic one. And we saw that both in general desire to bring fun back to being online, but also in the fresh variety of demos and workshops that we saw in the fun that was brought to the event. There were new and shocking implementations of Playground, I must say. Which, as far as I can tell, will basically be able to run everything one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But at WordCamp Europe, it ran; it powered our second massive hybrid translation event, where we translated something like 50,000 strings. We also had an amazing speed-building duel with an accepted future challenge between Jessica Lyschik and Matt Mullenweg. And not for nothing; the way we designed; the way the event area was put together included ways to stop and just have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a little grassy area with yard games and smaller pods of chairs for those quick hallway catch-ups that you just don&#8217;t get anywhere else. And for me, it was simply lovely to see everyone embracing the fun that was there, but also hearing about how much they wanted to help the web embrace the fun that could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:48] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Thanks for listening to my hallway track recap. Hopefully, it caused JOMO, not FOMO. And now, let&#8217;s turn our attention to the small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First thing on my list is WordPress 6.6 update. So we are reaching the release candidate phase tomorrow. WordPress 6.6 RC1 will be released, so download and join the community helping us to get this release out the door. It is scheduled for July 16th. If you have plugins or themes or any sort of business that uses WordPress, now is the time to get in and test it on a test site. I don&#8217;t recommend putting it in production at any point, but come and test it. Help us break it so that we can make sure that it doesn&#8217;t break for other people, for the, you know, 43% of the web that uses it when we get it out the door on the 16th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is that we have a WordPress Project Contributor Handbook V2 out there. It aims to be the quintessential resource for everyone in our community. And it will provide a bird&#8217;s eye view of where to find key information and different aspects of our community. How it all kind of connects together. And, just like a release, we really need some feedback from you. There is the repo on GitHub where you can go and kind of make inline comments, join the discussion about it. It can be a go-to resource if we look at it together and make sure that it has as much information as clearly stated as you wished you had when you were learning your way around WordPress for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on the list is actually another handbook. So, the Sustainability Team has put together a handbook specifically for events. It&#8217;s their first version, and over the past few months, members of that team have been sharing their ideas and experiences on how WordPress community events can be held more sustainably. All this input created a first draft, which eventually became this first version. And so we&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes, wander over there, take a look at it, see what some best practices for sustainable events are in the WordPress ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing on my list is about WordCamp US. I realize this is a podcast about WordCamp Europe right now. And so it&#8217;s odd to think that I&#8217;m moving right along into WordCamp US. However, there is a deadline coming up. July 1st is the last day to sign up to be a volunteer at this event. It&#8217;s taking place this year in Portland, Oregon, on the west side of the US. And it should be a really fun time. It&#8217;s middle of September. Come on out there. Learn about WordPress. Learn about contribution. Maybe get some voodoo donuts.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> A pivotal moment in my WordPress journey was when someone invited me to a WordCamp. I was sort of aware of WordPress, but certainly not aware of the community or the ways of open source. And when I look back, there were a few things I wish I had known going in. I am, of course, an unapologetic extrovert and therefore unstoppable at events, but if you are headed to your first WordCamp and are feeling a little nervous or confused, then pop in some earbuds because the next 10 minutes are for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We&#8217;re going to first take a look at some basic tactical things about WordCamps, and then I&#8217;m going to tell you a few, like, human things about being a human going to events. If you&#8217;re a dog going to these events, I think that your prep is different, but also that is not my area of expertise. So the first thing, some tactical stuff about going to WordCamps. All of this happens before you even get in the front door. And so this is stuff that you can do in the comfort of your own home, on your own time, using your own computer. If you&#8217;ve got questions, you&#8217;ve got a search engine nearby to take some quick searches. Make sure you know what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first things first, the shape of a WordCamp. All WordCamps have at least one day of talks, one social event, and sponsors to connect to. Some also have extra events that you need to sign up for, like Contributor Days, workshops, things like that. But we&#8217;ll start with the main event, right? We&#8217;re going to start with the day of talks and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So when we&#8217;re looking at the main event of a WordCamp, what you should do is you should head to the WordCamp&#8217;s website and check out the schedule. I suggest that you plan for two, maybe three things that you might want to learn and look around at the schedule to see if there are any presenters or presentations that look like they fit those things that you think you might want to learn. Because if it&#8217;s not working for you, if it&#8217;s not teaching you something, then you don&#8217;t necessarily need to be in that one. Even if you&#8217;re not sure about a session a talk that you&#8217;re planning to go to, I recommend that you stop by, and then if you find out that it&#8217;s not for you, you can leave again.  That&#8217;s fine. But I do encourage you to go to at least one thing that feels a little bit outside of your comfort zone. Even if you feel lost right now. It at least gives you an idea of what to search for once you do get to that point. I would never have known the things to search for early on in my learning of WordPress without going to at least one or two sessions that were just way over my head. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Second thing is don&#8217;t forget to check when lunch is available. And if you have dietary restrictions, let them know ahead of time. I realize this sounds silly, and I don&#8217;t know about you, but I can&#8217;t focus when I&#8217;m hungry. But also, it&#8217;s really a great, low-stakes networking time, and I think one of the overlooked networking times as well. I mean, everyone&#8217;s gotta eat, right? And it&#8217;s easier to strike up a conversation over a meal than just out of thin air or, you know, in the middle of a presentation when you&#8217;re supposed to be listening to a talk. So yeah, check out when lunch is happening! And yeah, make a friend or two, sit down at a table, and ask somebody what they&#8217;re doing with WordPress and how long they&#8217;ve been doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing that I would recommend that you do when you&#8217;re looking at kind of the main event for a WordCamp is to schedule in time to wander around and meet the event sponsors. They are all experts in some WordPress problem or other, so probably they have a solution to a problem that you have got. But they&#8217;re also how we keep our prices super low, so even if you have no problems or you think you have no problems. Still, check them out. They&#8217;re also staffed with wonderful people that are building really cool stuff with WordPress and so you might just get some inspiration out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now for the side events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the side events, we&#8217;re going to kind of start close to the main event and work our way out. So you&#8217;ve got generally three types of side events if you don&#8217;t count the networking things, which, in this case, I&#8217;m not. But just know that almost every WordCamp has some networking event, either an after-party or, like, a happy hour, a social that happens before the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll get emails about those if you have signed up for updates on the website. Also, you can look on the website directly. Just check out the schedule. Always go to those. The networking is the best at a WordCamp. But the side events—we&#8217;re talking about specific types. Like I said, we&#8217;re going to start close and work our way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, workshops. These are just what they sound like. They&#8217;re classroom-style opportunities to practice the things you&#8217;ve learned at meetup events or on learn.WordPress.org, depending on how you found your way to this WordCamp. They mostly happen during the WordCamp itself. in a separate track, and there are like stacks of workshops in that track in that series of sessions. But a lot of them do require preregistration simply so that the trainer has an idea of how many people to expect. Again, if you get in the workshop and it&#8217;s way over your head, you feel like you absolutely cannot get it done, you&#8217;re always welcome to leave and check out some other area. But, in general, the workshops that we have WordCamps are pretty solid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a little bit further removed from that are our Youth and Teen Days. So this is more of an event series that is specifically designed for teens or kids who are trying to learn more about WordPress and other related business and entrepreneurial topics. It&#8217;s kind of a catch all but also has a lot of WordPress content in it. They have age limits, of course, and require separate registration for safety and planning purposes both. And those, in general, are either half-day during the WordCamp itself or a full-day during that WordCamp. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us then to the big one, the major side event. This is a full-day side event called Contributor Day. If your WordCamp has a Contributor Day, it will happen either the day before or the day after the WordCamp itself. It is an entire day where attendees come together to learn how to contribute to the future of the WordPress open source project. Now, if you are listening to this as part of, like, you&#8217;re getting ready to go to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what I meant by open source or open source project or WordPress open source project, that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You&#8217;re going to learn all about it at the Contributor Day if you go, but the TLDR is that this software that you are about to choose to build your website on is built by thousands of people across the planet who are looking for the best solutions to problems that they have in their businesses that probably you will encounter or have encountered before. There&#8217;s no new problems under the sun, and open source methodologies kind of use the collective wisdom of everybody who has ever worked with a WordPress project or site and ran into a problem that they had to solve on their own, like this open source project, this community of people just make sure that that wisdom is collected and standardized and made available for all of eternity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all you need to know. Low key. I&#8217;ve made Contributor Days sound so calming. However, that is a whole day thing. It happens before or after the WordCamp. It has separate registration so that organizers of your WordCamp can plan for how many folks need to be there to teach new and returning contributors, what to do. If I&#8217;m going to be honest, if you&#8217;re going to get overwhelmed at any WordPress event, it&#8217;s going to be one of these, but they are well worth the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Even if you just make a single contribution and never return, which I hope is not the case for you. I hope you do return. Even if you make a single contribution and never return, there&#8217;s something really grounding about seeing how much expertise and time, and care goes into this software that is, against all odds, completely free. So that&#8217;s all the tactical stuff, or a lot of it anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It at least gives you a sense for what you&#8217;re getting yourself into for your first-ever wonderful WordPress weekend. But I promised you some human stuff too. So here is my considerably shorter list of stuff to bring as a human being going to a WordCamp. There&#8217;s an optional one. I&#8217;ll start you off with an optional one. Come with an idea of what you think you want to learn. You don&#8217;t have to come with that if you don&#8217;t want to. Some of us don&#8217;t know what we don&#8217;t know yet, and that&#8217;s fine too. But if you have a sense for what you think you need to learn, you&#8217;ll have an easier time figuring out how to spend your time while you&#8217;re here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, the non-optional things. Bring some way to exchange information. It can be QR codes, business cards, or pen and paper. It doesn&#8217;t really matter as long as it&#8217;s something that works for you to be sharing information with people that you meet. Because you never know when you&#8217;re going to meet your business soulmate, but the odds that you&#8217;re going to do it at a WordCamp are pretty dang high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing to bring is bring what you need to be comfortable. Bring your water bottle, a change of shoes if you need it, spare battery for your phone, your glasses. This day is going to be long enough without worrying about small inconveniences. So bring what you need to make yourself comfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And finally bring your bravery. You will not know by looking at someone whether they&#8217;ve been doing WordPress stuff for two years or two weeks. But you can know that at some point, they were in the first two days of trying to figure this all out. One of the most endearing things about this community is the zeal they bring to solving a problem. So if you get lost or stuck, just ask the person next to you. We all remember what it was like to know nothing, and we are rooting for you to succeed. And that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s your whole list. That&#8217;s everything you need to know to be the most prepared first-time attendee to a WordCamp ever. If that all sounded more overwhelming than just showing up, don&#8217;t worry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also just show up. That&#8217;s what I did. And even though I knew next to nothing, those WordCampers made me feel welcome and included and kept me coming back to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Ah, WordCamps. Gosh, I love those things. So glad that we&#8217;re all getting back together for them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] (Music interlude) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now, my friends, to our small list of big things. If you&#8217;re a first-time WordPresser, if you&#8217;ve never been to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what any of these things are, don&#8217;t worry; you can still go take a look at them, or you can wait until later when you&#8217;re less overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, but this is our small list of big things for middle of the year 2024. First thing on my list, the gender equality in WordPress businesses survey is still open. It aims to gain critical insight into the gender composition of leadership teams, the experiences of women and gender-diverse leaders and employees, and also take a look at the challenges and barriers to their career success. I care deeply about making sure that we have a way for folks who are traditionally and historically underrepresented in technology have a way to get into our space. Obviously, women and nonbinary folks are an area that I feel particularly called to help build those on-ramps for, but I have a great concern for that across the entire ecosystem and any intersection that we run into as we get more and more users into our space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you are a woman, if you work with women, if you work in WordPress, if you work in a WordPress business, go take that survey, and let&#8217;s see what we find out about what it&#8217;s like to work in this space, as somebody that we normally don&#8217;t see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our list is that WordCamp Asia 2025 dates and venue have been revealed. So WordCamp Asia 2023 and 2024 were both major successes, and we are excited to share that the dates and venue for next year will be February 20th, 21st, 22nd in 2025 in Manila, and you&#8217;ll be able to go over to that website, take a look at it, we&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes as always and maybe start planning your your next big Asian adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on my list is this new contributor wizard questionnaire. So, there are more than 20 teams to contribute to in the WordPress project. They all show up at those Contributor Days that I talked about. But there are more than 20 of them. They work on different parts of the WordPress project every day. And our passionate community offers contribution opportunities for everyone. I know, we know, that finding the right team is the key to a meaningful contributor experience. So, our interactive questionnaire is here to help you determine where to start. It is sometimes difficult to know whether you can contribute to a software if you are a designer, if you are a writer, if you are in marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it turns out that you can contribute to WordPress with a bunch of skills that you otherwise would not have realized. So, we&#8217;ll have a link to the questionnaire in the show notes again. Also, it&#8217;s probably going to pop up on WordCamp sites, Contributor Day sites, anything that helps you all understand where you might find a little bit of success as a contributor is a good place for it to be. Take the questionnaire, see where you land, the WordPress sorting hat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And item number four. So we&#8217;ve made some updates, not we&#8217;ve made some updates, we have some updates from the Five for the Future program. So the Five for the Future program has a long history in the WordPress project. There are a couple of different episodes in this podcast where you can learn more about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, to bolster transparency and openness, we have an update on the current state of WordPress contributions as of the end of May 2024. In the past few months, we&#8217;ve made a lot of efforts to improve the program and contributor experience in WordPress. We&#8217;ve also done a little bit of work to kind of clean up the pledges that are in there for, people or companies or teams that have found that they couldn&#8217;t continue their contributions over time. That is fine too. But we&#8217;ll have a link to that update in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I am your host, Josepha Haden Chomposy. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:36] (Music outro) </p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"17352\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"WordPress 6.5.4 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/06/wordpress-6-5-4-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 15:57:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17340\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:345:\"WordPress 6.5.4 is now available!This minor release features 5 bug fixes in Core.

Please follow the project&#8217;s responsible-disclosure practices detailed on this <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\">HackerOne page</a> and in this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/security/\">security white paper</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s coming to WordPress 6.6?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s second major release is about polish and finesse. Features that landed in the last few releases have new flexibility and smoother flows—and a few new tricks. And of course there are a few brand-new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data Views updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the groundwork for phase 3, Data Views get new and improved experience of working with information in the Site Editor. A new layout consolidates patterns and template parts, gets you to general management views in fewer clicks, and packs in a wide range of refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overrides in synced patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could keep a synced pattern‘s <em>look and feel</em> everywhere it appears—keeping it on brand—but have different <em>content</em> everywhere it appears?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, maybe you‘re building a pattern for recipes. Ideally, you want to keep the overall design of the recipe card consistent on every post that will have a recipe. But the recipe itself—the ingredients, the steps, special notes on technique—will be different every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And perhaps, in the future, other people might need to change the design of the recipe pattern. It would be nice to know they can do that, and that the content in existing recipes will stay right where it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In version 6.6, you can make all that happen, and overrides in synced patterns are the way you do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">See all the blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to now, when you had a block selected and then opened the block Inserter, you only saw the blocks you were allowed to add to your selected block. Where were all the others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 6.6, when you have a block selected, you get two lists. First, there&#8217;s the list of blocks you can insert at your selected block. Then you get a list with all the other blocks. So you can get an idea of what you can use in your selected block, and what other blocks you could use in another area. In fact, if you select a block from that second list, WordPress 6.6 will add it below your block, to use in whatever you build next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A new publish flow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 6.6 brings the post and site editors closer together than ever. So whether you’re writing for a post in the post editor or a page in the Site Editor, your experience will be about the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Style variations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If a block theme comes with style variations, 6.6 vastly expands your design options right out of the box, without installing or configuring a single thing. Because in 6.6, your theme  pulls the color palettes and typography style sets out of its installed variations to let you mix and match for a whole world of expanded creative expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Section styles </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you build themes? Now you can define style options for separate sections of multiple blocks, including inner blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then your users can apply those block style variations to entire groups of blocks, effectively creating branded sections they can curate across a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A note about CSS specificity</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it easier for your variations to override the global styles CSS, those styles now come wrapped in `:root`. That limits their specificity. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/61810\">For details, read the full discussion on GitHub.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A native Grid layout</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grid is a new variation for the Group block that lets you arrange the blocks inside it as a grid. If you&#8217;ve been using a plugin for this, now you can make your grids natively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Better pattern management in Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You heard right: You can do everything with patterns in Classic themes that you can in a block theme. You can see all the patterns available to you in a single view and insert a pattern on the fly. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Negative. Margins.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re here: negative margin values, so you can make objects overlap in your design. As a guardrail, you can only set a negative margin by typing an actual negative number, not by using the slider. That’s to keep people from adding negative values they didn&#8217;t intend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rollback auto-updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can have the convenience of setting all your plugins to auto-update and the inner peace you get from knowing that if anything goes wrong, 6.6 will do a rollback. Automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This post <strong><em>reflects the latest changes</em></strong> as of June 4, 2024.</em></strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Again, the features in this first beta

I&#8217;m Robbie Adair from OS Training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />And I&#8217;m Robert Jacobi from Botguard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie and Robert:<br />And we&#8217;re here to camp you up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />We&#8217;re thrilled to have Ronnie Burt from Gravatar at the Automattic Sound Stage at WordCamp Europe 2024 Torino. Welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Hey, thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />So you&#8217;re supposed to tell us all about some of the cool stuff that Gravatar is doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Gravatar is 20 years old. It&#8217;s been in WordPress core for a long time, and we are reviving it and making it a profile-as-a-service. For the developers out there, use our APIs to have a much easier way of setting up whatever you need with anything profile-related: avatars, social connections, all that kind of thing. This is another way of building the open web and helping people connect, breaking down those barriers for everyone. We have free profiles and free Linkin Bio pages. You set them up, fill out your details, and that can be another place for you to point people to on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Ronnie, on the spot now. This can&#8217;t just be show and tell. What about single sign-on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yes, single sign-on is something we&#8217;re still working on. We want to get it right because when you&#8217;re dealing with something like single sign-on, security is super important. We&#8217;re continuing to test, but our goal is to have another option out there that is passwordless and supports passkeys out of the box for the WordPress ecosystem and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Cool. And you have some nice little toys here that you guys are giving out. Tell us about those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yeah, these are a lot of fun. They&#8217;re NFC tags, little round tags that you can put on your lanyard or, as I have, in my backpack. You tap them on your phone, and your Gravatar profile pops up. So instead of a business card, it opens up a browser window. Now I have everyone&#8217;s profiles that I&#8217;ve scanned as a tab in my browser on my phone today, and you can easily contact someone or follow them on X or whatever you&#8217;re following people on these days. It&#8217;s just better than the old paper business cards that we often throw away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Cool. I use LinkedIn quite often that way, but not everyone is on LinkedIn. So then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh no, I&#8217;m not on that,&#8221; and you have to figure out something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yeah, they&#8217;re not on it, or they&#8217;re not logged in at that moment. So when they click the link, it&#8217;s not there. They can&#8217;t even follow you because it opens up in the browser, and they have the app on their phone or whatever. Ours just opens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />There&#8217;s got to be some other cool stuff you could do with this. Maybe like a giant WordCamp at the end of the year where this simple, inexpensive tech could be deployed on everyone&#8217;s badge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yeah, badges would be great. We&#8217;d love for everyone to be happy to curate their profile. If you don&#8217;t want your real name on it, contact information, or an avatar photo, that&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s important information for others to know. You want to be anonymous or whatever it is. But when we&#8217;re trying to connect and grow a community or follow each other, this is a much easier way of doing it once. Wherever you go, whatever kind of conference or event, you don&#8217;t have to fill out another profile. It&#8217;s reusable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />So it&#8217;s not WordPress-specific?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />No, not at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />You keep talking about open. What does that actually mean? I can&#8217;t set up a Gravatar server?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Well, not at the moment. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about decentralization. We have a schema of data and how it&#8217;s stored, curated from different sources of standards for storing profile data. We&#8217;re hoping to use things like webfinger and other standards so that if someone wanted to host the data elsewhere, locally, or on their own site, they could do that. We could be the connection, like a switchboard, to have that data accessible via the API if you wanted it to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Boy, I&#8217;m just hogging the mic here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />You are. It&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Except for Ronnie. I&#8217;m hogging. Can I just type in gravatar.com/myhandle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yep. That works. You can also, hopefully any day now, have any domain you want point to your Gravatar profile. You can get the domain through WordPress.com, and it&#8217;ll automatically connect to your profile. Eventually, we&#8217;ll open that up to existing domains and domains registered anywhere. It&#8217;s an interesting concept. Services like Blue Sky are using domains as usernames, but there&#8217;s no profile to point to for those domains. I hope more services integrate that so you don&#8217;t have to rush to get a username on every new service that pops up. You can use your domain as your username and another way of logging in, which can be another aspect of your digital identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Will you support third-level domains, like if I wanted contact.RobbieAdair.com to go to my Gravatar profile?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />I hope so. We&#8217;re still working on that. You can definitely do a redirect, but that&#8217;s not the same as it being the domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Oh, note to self: redirect me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Yeah, you just can&#8217;t point an A record to it, I guess, is what you&#8217;re saying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />But that&#8217;s definitely on our list that our teams are working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />What about company profiles versus individual profiles? Can I make an OSTraining profile like I do on LinkedIn or any other social media platform?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yeah, we have a lot of those. Every profile is just an email address, so you can set one up for whatever email address you want. It doesn&#8217;t need to be a person or your legal identity. It can be a persona, a company, or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />A bot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />It can be a bot. That&#8217;s an interesting use case for our API. In this era of bots, we have verification. When you connect your Meta account, WordPress.com account, Instagram account, or whatever to your Gravatar, we&#8217;re saying that the same person with this profile has all of these accounts. This helps verify that this profile belongs together, and there&#8217;s not really anything like that. People can use the API to figure out how human or how long this email address has been in use around the web, and how many places it&#8217;s being used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Is that already accessible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yeah, all via our REST API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />That&#8217;s cool. Sorry, Robbie, before I forget, I have one huge wish. Are we going to be able to change our wp.org usernames?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />I don&#8217;t know anything about .org usernames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Darn it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />What about the handy dandy chip? Do you also have QR codes it generates for us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yes. When you log into your profile, there are QR codes you can download and use. I&#8217;ve seen this a few times at farmer&#8217;s markets, musicians, all these places where people have a Venmo QR code, an Instagram QR code, and a wall of QR codes. Instead, they could have their QR code to their Gravatar profile. At the top of the profile, they can list their Venmo, Instagram, etc. It&#8217;s a much easier user experience. I think that&#8217;s a great free use case for creators and small businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Awesome. You&#8217;ve mentioned a few things, but can you tell us the roadmap for the rest of this year and maybe next year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Going back to OAuth and authentication, we&#8217;re still working on it. We have more domain stuff coming and will spend a lot of time on Linkin Bio Service. We were the original Linkin Bio service 20 years ago, but there were no Linkin Bios then. We&#8217;re figuring out what people would like to see on this page. We don&#8217;t want to turn it into a whole website, but you&#8217;ll see a lot of focus on making those more customizable and useful for different use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />That&#8217;s excellent. I&#8217;m excited. I don&#8217;t like using paper cards, so anything that makes my life easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah, me neither. Update everything at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />I haven&#8217;t carried cards in so long, and I usually try to default to LinkedIn or something I think people will have. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve had to show people how to use LinkedIn that way. Sometimes you don&#8217;t want to send your full contact to someone else. This is nice because it gives them the option of whether they want to save this as a contact, correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Exactly. You can enable a contact form so you&#8217;re not sharing your personal data, but they can choose to send you a message. We limit the message to half a tweet or half an old tweet, so like a hundred characters or less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Half an old tweet, half a UX. 75 characters or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />It&#8217;s on purpose. We don&#8217;t want people to send you a bunch of spam and sales stuff. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;We just met at WCU, let&#8217;s follow up in two weeks.&#8221; You get all of their Gravatar contact information and profile data in the email, and you can choose to reply. It&#8217;s a nice handy way of making contacts in person a little smoother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />We&#8217;re going to need an app for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />You can&#8217;t see Ronnie&#8217;s face, but that was a wink, wink, nudge, nudge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah. I love the little chip, but I don&#8217;t always want to have it with me. Could we have it in our wallet on our iPhone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron</p>\n\n\n\n<p>nie:<br />Absolutely. That&#8217;s going to come a lot faster than the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />That works for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah, works for me too. Great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Awesome. What&#8217;s the best way to get ahold of you? I hope it&#8217;s gravatar.com/ronnie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yes, gravatar.com/ronnie, R-O-N-N-I-E, or Ronnie Link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Woohoo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />He&#8217;s already got his custom domain ready to go. I love it. Fancy. Well, thank you so much, Ronnie, for chatting with us. Kudos on it. I love it, and now I&#8217;m going to go get my chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Thank you very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Thank you, Robbie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Thanks, Robert. It&#8217;s fun. I will see you on the next episode of Do the Woo.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of<strong><em> All Things WordPress and WooCommerce</em></strong>, hosts <strong>Robbie Adair</strong> and <strong>Robert Jacobi</strong> have a great chat with <strong>Ronnie Burt from Automattic and Gravatar</strong>, during WordCamp Europe 2024 in Torino. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their conversation jumps into the exciting advancements and features that Gravatar is introducing as it celebrates its 20th anniversary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is being revived and expanded to offer profiles as a service. Developers can use Gravatar&#8217;s APIs to set up profiles, avatars, social connections, and other profile-related functionalities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar offers free profiles and Linkin Bio pages where users can fill out their details and use it as a point of contact on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is working on implementing a secure, passwordless single sign-on feature that supports passkeys, enhancing the security and ease of user authentication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar provides NFC tags that users can attach to their lanyards or backpacks. When tapped on a phone, these tags open the user&#8217;s Gravatar profile, serving as a modern alternative to business cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can download QR codes from their Gravatar profile, making it easy to share contact information and social media links in a single, streamlined manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar will soon allow users to point any domain to their Gravatar profile, enhancing personal branding and simplifying digital identity management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can create profiles for companies, personas, or even bots, not just individuals. This flexibility allows for diverse use cases, including business and personal branding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar&#8217;s API can be used to verify the ownership and connectivity of multiple accounts (e.g., Meta, WordPress.com, Instagram) to a single profile, helping to establish a verified digital identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar profiles can include contact forms that allow users to send messages without sharing personal data. The messages are limited in length to prevent spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upcoming features include enhanced OAuth and authentication, more domain functionalities, and customizable Linkin Bio pages. Gravatar aims to refine and expand these services based on user feedback and evolving needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://gravatar.com\">Gravatar.com</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/ronnie\">Ronnie&#8217;s Gravatar </a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Jun 2024 08:17:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"Do The Woo Community: A Special Host Event and Our Sponsorship at WordCamp Europe\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=84284\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://dothewoo.io/a-special-host-event-and-our-sponsorship-at-wordcamp-europe/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:435:\"Episode Transcript\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Today BobWP, after a bit of conference crud post- WordCamp Europe, has a chance to share his experience at WCEU plus highlighting two special moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A party for our new hosts Marcel and Mike via Woo DevChat and what it meant to Do the Woo to sponsor WordCamp Europe 2024.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jun 2024 08:28:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Gravatar: .Link Your Gravatar Profile With A Free Custom Domain\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=1527\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/26/link-your-gravatar-profile-with-a-free-custom-domain/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5304:\"<p>Every Gravatar account comes with a free customizable profile page — the original link-in-bio and your home on the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months ago, we rolled out the ability to <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/03/28/new-gravatar-profile-features-make-it-yours/\">customize your profile URL</a>. Based on the positive feedback and overwhelming interest, we decided to take it a step further by partnering with .link to roll out custom domains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part: act now, and your personalized .link domain is on us (as in free!) for the first year. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How it works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All users have the ability to set a custom “slug” for their profile URLs, which means you can send people to something that looks like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>gravatar.com/yourusername</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that’s a great start, many users, brands, and businesses like using their own domain. That means that the link you share on your profiles, email signatures, business cards, etc. will look more like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>yourusername.link</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why you should be excited:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It puts your brand or identity first</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It’s easy to remember</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Custom domains are more trustworthy and receive almost 30% higher click-through rates than generic links.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using a custom domain levels up your professionalism and credibility.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can use it to connect your presence <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/03/14/a-social-experience-with-your-domain/\">across the web</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Start by logging in to your profile on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gravatar.com/profile\">Gravatar.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will land on your profile dashboard. At the very top left corner of the screen, you will see an area with your current URL and a headline that says ”Your profile URL is” with <a href=\"http://gravatar.com/yourusername\">gravatar.com/yourusername</a>. Just to the right, you will see two text links. Click on the one that says “Change”.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cleanshot-2024-06-26-at-10.25.09402x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1535\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>You should automatically see the .link domain that matches your current username, go ahead and click on the &#8216;Claim domain&#8217; link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>You will be taken to a checkout screen for your domain, but the price will be $0 for the first year of registration. Proceed with the checkout process and we’ll handle the rest. You can search for other available .link domains to use, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Then What?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve secured your custom .link domain, the magic really begins. Here&#8217;s how you can maximize the benefits and make the most out of your new digital identity:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Integrate Across Platforms:</strong> Update your profiles on social media, professional networks, and other online platforms to include your new .link domain. This ensures a consistent and professional online presence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhance Your Email Signature:</strong> Replace your current profile link with your new custom .link domain in your email signature. This looks more professional and makes it easier for contacts to remember and visit your profile.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Business Cards and Marketing Materials:</strong> Include your .link domain on your business cards, brochures, and other marketing materials. This small change can significantly enhance the credibility and professionalism of your brand.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Track Engagement:</strong> Use URL tracking tools to monitor the performance of your new domain. This will help you understand where your traffic is coming from and how people engage with your profile.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Join the Movement</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t miss out on this opportunity to enhance your online identity and stand out in the digital space. By hosting your Gravatar profile on a custom .link domain, you&#8217;re not just adopting a new URL; you&#8217;re embracing a new era of digital identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more services like Bluesky offering domains as usernames, this space will continue to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional domain extensions (like .com, .me, .blog, and more) will become available for a fee in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why .link?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://nova.link/why-link/\">.link domain</a> is more than just an address on the web. It&#8217;s a declaration of connectivity, a badge of identity in the digital realm, and a key to unlocking a world where your online presence is seen and felt. By reserving your unique .link domain, you&#8217;re taking full control of your connected identity on the web while building a more memorable and trustworthy brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feel free to share your experiences and feedback with us. We&#8217;re excited to see how you&#8217;ll leverage your new .link domain to elevate your digital footprint. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gravatar.com/profiles\">Claim your free .link domain now!</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Jun 2024 15:27:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Ronnie Burt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: #125 – Davinder Singh Kainth on Content Creation and Business Strategy in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=156506\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/125-davinder-singh-kainth-on-content-creation-and-business-strategy-in-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43090:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how to build trust and foster relationships within the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and then you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Davinder Singh Kainth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davinder is a WordPress creative, an entrepreneur, and a sharer of knowledge. He&#8217;s been in the online ecosystem for over 20 years, and his journey from blogging to design, development and entrepreneurship is anchored in the WordPress world. He writes about WordPress every week at thewpweekly.com newsletter, and also has a sideline in website creation, coaching and consulting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we get into a discussion that extends beyond traditional agency work. We talk about the opportunities available in plugin and theme development, SEO, hosting, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davinder offers his advice on trying to figure out the nuances of the WordPress ecosystem to promote your credibility and ensure longevity. We chat about the importance of having diversified revenue streams, the intricacies of targeting WordPress users with SaaS products, and the vital role that referrals play in agency success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davinder also discusses the need for adaptability persistence and carving out one&#8217;s unique path in the WordPress world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also touch upon the community spirit found at WordCamp events, and the significant impact of that engaging with the WordPress community can have on professional opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in practical advice on how the WordPress community can work with you, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Davinder Singh Kainth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Davinder Singh Kanith How are you doing Davinder?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:06] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> Hi, I am doing good. Thanks for inviting me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are very welcome. I was lucky enough to bump into Davinda, not that long ago in WordCamp Asia. It was very nice to meet you in person. I think it&#8217;s fair to say that we&#8217;ve had quite a lot of exchanges over the years. I think probably you and I got to know each other in the Beaver Builder community, I would imagine that&#8217;s where it all began for me and you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:27] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> Absolutely. Beaver Builder, the awesome page builder that has spread the awesomeness in different fields, be it podcasting, or maybe newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ve definitely had our moments, and I&#8217;m very thankful for Davinder talking to us today. And we&#8217;re going to talk about the WordPress community, and much more than that. How to be a good custodian in WordPress. How to sell your products into WordPress successfully. Loads of different things. But before we do that, Davinder, in case there&#8217;s anybody listening to this who hasn&#8217;t heard of you before, do you just want to give us your bio, tell us who you are, where you&#8217;re from, what it is you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:58] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> Okay, I am from India, place called Chandigarh. Which is like six hour drive from the capital New Delhi, North India. I&#8217;ve been into WordPress ever since WordPress existed. Started as a blogger, then went into usual design, development agency world. And now, plus the agency, I do mostly content creation, email marketing funnels, that&#8217;s like my interest area, so all things WordPress as the foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you still run a business building client websites, things like that? Or is it more the kind of content creation, the newsletters that you make for the community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:32] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> You know, for the last two or three years, I did not have any new client, because I didn&#8217;t need one. Because the old clients kept me busy, and I love them because at this stage of my professional career, I only want people who don&#8217;t eat my brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;ve got various different endeavors. Maybe the one that most people have heard of is The WP Weekly. Anything that we mention in today&#8217;s podcast, where Davinder might have connection, I will make sure that goes into the show notes. But that&#8217;s certainly worth signing up for. If you want a weekly dose of WordPress news, that&#8217;s highly recommended. What day does it drop?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> Monday morning, India time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so we&#8217;re going to get into the WordPress community, and how to sell yourself into that community, and how to be a good custodian. You suggested this topic, so I&#8217;m just going to throw it over to you and ask you, what was your intention here? What was it that you wanted to get across?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:20] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> Knowing WordPress is good, a lot of people know how to install WordPress and, you know, spin up a new website. But knowing the business of WordPress is very critical, if you want to stay in this ecosystem for a long time, financially, creatively and have the overall satisfaction. Now, I understand not everyone is made for working as an employee, and not everyone is made, or has the jobs, or interest of being an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think a lot of people join WordPress for the sake of, it&#8217;s a free open source platform, but they soon realise it&#8217;s not free. There&#8217;s a big money making hierarchy, where you spend money, and you make money, but you only discover it way down the line. And all this is coming from running WP Weekly, and getting new people approaching me and saying, oh, I&#8217;ve made this product, can you share it, because I&#8217;m literally lost in how to promote it, right? And how to get eyeballs to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because creating is just a small part of the overall picture. People don&#8217;t realise that once they create it, and no one actually visits your website, or even interacts with your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think the journey should start from exploring various things in the WordPress world, and finding your sweet spot. Because, again, if you see everyone&#8217;s journey, like majority of people, even you included Nathan, like we all start with an agency, right? Sort of like fancy agency name. We look for clients and figure out how to service them. And guess what? Majority of us actually then jump from agency to something different, something that interests us, like you went to podcasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, obviously when you were running your agency, you would&#8217;ve never imagined like you would do a podcast like WP Builds. It all came out of your passion for talking to people. And I&#8217;m sure when you started WP Builds, you had a hundred percent idea that it&#8217;s not going to make you any money from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s how it begins, right? You basically funnel your whole knowledge of running an agency into something you are more passionate about. And suddenly those light bulbs in your path lights up, and it financially becomes viable. Plus you get the creative satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I always tell to people like, yes, go into the ecosystem, explore things, but find a channel, find a thing that interests you, rather than copying someone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s okay to take inspiration, like Nathan is doing good with WP Builds, I&#8217;ll start a new podcast called WPBuilding.com. Just take an inspiration. But, again, it&#8217;s not just the podcast, it&#8217;s a personality of a person, how you deliver it, how people interact with you. So find your sweet spot, and then focus on it. That&#8217;s my main foundational advice to anyone who comes to me. And I know it is a very vague thing, but that&#8217;s how it is. I&#8217;m sure even you also did your whole journey until now in the WordPress space like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think what&#8217;s really interesting is that the WordPress ecosystem is so much bigger than it would appear. And I would imagine that there&#8217;s actually very few people out there who truly have an understanding of all of the different pieces that make up whatever WordPress is. You know, the multi billions, possibly even trillions, I don&#8217;t know, that the WordPress ecosystem per year will generate, across the planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re right. When I began, my intuition was that it was a piece of software used to create websites, and so I followed the playbook of, I must have a business which will make websites, and that was fine. So, you know, I started to follow people on YouTube, and look at that. And then after exploring the WordPress community, and in my case, it was exploring Facebook groups, which were popping up all over the place at that time. I discovered that there were people out there who were like me, but there were a load of other people who were not like me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in my case, as you said, I began a podcast. You&#8217;ve obviously hived off into content creation in different ways. So that&#8217;s really fascinating. It&#8217;s big enough to not just think that the agency route is the only way to succeed. There&#8217;s probably thousands of different paths that you take, whether that&#8217;s being a plugin developer, a theme developer, an SEO person, into hosting in some way, content creation. Honestly, the list could go on. I could keep talking for ages, and I&#8217;ve talked to many of these people in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the size of the ecosystem is big enough to support all of that. But unless you start to explore and peel back the curtain a little bit, and try to figure out what this community looks like, you&#8217;ll never see it, right? You won&#8217;t know that that exists, and you&#8217;ll think agency, that&#8217;s what we do, that&#8217;s all WordPress is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:53] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> Even if, when you&#8217;re running an agency, if you recall, your best clients actually came from referrals from your friends, rather than looking at your fancy website, or your Google ads, or Facebook ads during those times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s true. There was still a connection to the real world back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I think that there&#8217;s something kind of unique about this community. I&#8217;ve talked about it many times before, and I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on what it is, but I think it&#8217;s connected to open source. I think there is something about a person who is willing to spend time in an open source community, that is a little bit different than somebody, not somebody, it&#8217;s more the thing, the open source thing than the person. But the nature of those communities are different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, if I show up to a WordPress event, so I recently met you at WordCamp Asia. It&#8217;s very open. You&#8217;ve got competitors openly talking to each other when the event has closed down for the evening. You know, you&#8217;ve got hosting companies all going out to have a drink and a meal together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think in other communities, let&#8217;s say it was, I don&#8217;t know, a Cisco networking event. I think we&#8217;re going to have a different flavour. The camaraderie might be a bit more superficial, and you wouldn&#8217;t be encouraged maybe to go and have a meal with your competitors. So, do you think there&#8217;s anything in that? Do you think the community, the open source nature of it, promotes a different ethos, a different relationship?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:16] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> Oh, a hundred percent, because WordPress is the only community where you will see competitors, not just sitting together, but sharing their challenges, sharing their wins, sharing their learnings, and sharing, hey, what am I going to do next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even though they have exactly similar products, right? And that is the best part of WordPress. Obviously we have conflicts here and there, but they are very minimal compared to the overall picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WordCamp is an excellent example. Like, you see two hosting companies, you know, booths, sponsor booths, next to each other, and all the employees, all the founders, co-founders, they&#8217;re talking to each other like friends, right? And you may not be using that hosting, but you still would know the people behind it. Because, again, it is not about the end product or the service, it&#8217;s about the people. Because when you talk to people, you learn a lot. If you are a good listener, you can be a good creator down the line, that&#8217;s for sure. And WordCamps and other, you know, local WordCamp meetups, they give an excellent platform and opportunity to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s absolutely loads of WordPress events going on. It obviously took a bit of a hit after, well, during and after the pandemic, but we seem to be, in some parts of the world at least, getting out of that and getting back into the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s our first point really, it&#8217;s about exploring the multitude of different things that are out there. Don&#8217;t assume that WordPress is just an agency software. It may begin that way for you, but attend things even if that&#8217;s online. Get yourself in the community. Explore a little bit, and you may discover that there&#8217;s a whole different thing that you are capable of doing. Not just capable, it might be that your superpower is something that you never imagined. And you stumble across it, and it&#8217;s fascinating that I&#8217;ve ended up doing podcasting. Like you said, that was never, ever, the intention, and yet here we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once you&#8217;ve got yourself into the community, another thing that you&#8217;ve written in our shared show notes is about the way that you may pitch yourself, or market yourself. And so I think a lot of people in the community, they&#8217;ll come in, and they&#8217;ll build something, and they&#8217;ll assume that the building of that thing might be the only thing that they need to do. So build a product, build a plugin, build a theme, build a whatever it is. Go to an event, and then just start talking about it, and assume that that&#8217;s going to be all that you need to do. But I feel you are saying there&#8217;s a little bit more, you need to be a little bit different, have a different approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:37] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> Hundred percent, because before building a product, build yourself. When I say build yourself, it&#8217;s your visibility, your name, your expertise, the value you bring to the ecosystem. And how do you do that? It&#8217;s just start connecting with people in the WordPress ecosystem. And you can do it at various platforms, at various ways, at various times. Because once you start sharing what you know, this initialises the cycle of value exchange. And you can do it at a lot of places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t want to participate in a Facebook group, just go to official WordPress forums and start replying to questions. Some of them are really basic questions, and you can just reply it and you can build your visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously there&#8217;s LinkedIn, there&#8217;s Twitter, and there&#8217;s other online events, like you had Page Builder Summit. It&#8217;s such an amazing way to get introduced to new people who are doing the same thing in the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So start interacting, start communicating, because, again, there&#8217;s a school of thought. If I&#8217;m going to spend some time listening to a podcast, reading a blog post, or participating in a Facebook group, that&#8217;s like a waste of time. Why would I do that? I would just rather spend it on building my service or a product. But people forget, the time that you&#8217;re spending there interacting is basically you&#8217;re investing. You&#8217;re investing in building your portfolio in the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because again, if I run an agency and someone comes to me with a specific requirement, say, I want to build an app that talks to WordPress. Now, if I already know a person who&#8217;s been doing that, I will gladly refer that person to that specific person, because I trust that person, and know that that person has a specific expertise in that specific thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in your case, if someone comes to you for, say, I want to build a website with Beaver Builder, you already know people who use Beaver Builder, or people who use Elementor, or any other specific page builder, right? Once you&#8217;re there in the ecosystem, you already know people doing what, what, what. So yeah, get into the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, it is a slow process, but slow process gives you returns down the line. So don&#8217;t expect immediate returns. Even your example, like people build, I&#8217;ve seen this in WordCamp also, in recent WordCamps that I&#8217;ve attended. People will build a product or a service, and they will sponsor a WordCamp and sit there, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you have initial money, yes, go for the sponsorship route. Because, again, this is also another way, another natural way of getting people introduced to yourself. Because once you have your booth on there, and you have people who are working for you, they start interacting with people who are visiting it. They are also fellow entrepreneurs or service. They might be your customer, but it&#8217;s just like introducing your brand, because once they know your brand, they won&#8217;t feel alien when some of their customers come and ask, hey, I saw this brand, is it good enough? And you will recall back, oh, I saw this brand, I talked to that person from that specific brand at the WordCamp, and yeah, why not? It&#8217;s legitimate, go for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I have an intuition that it&#8217;s easy for people who are not in the WordPress community, haven&#8217;t been for any length of time, I think it&#8217;s easy to misunderstand what will sell effectively into the WordPress ecosystem. What I mean by that, and I&#8217;m not going to mention any names, either when I talk positively or maybe negatively. But I&#8217;ve definitely come across individuals who have gone from no presence in the WordPress space, to being able to schmooze with everybody, because they&#8217;ve really put in that effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that effort that they&#8217;ve done, and schmooze is probably the wrong word because it has a fairly negative connotation, but they&#8217;ve come to the events, in some cases they may have sponsored the events, but they&#8217;ve been available, they&#8217;ve talked to people, they&#8217;ve made connections, they&#8217;ve joined groups, and they&#8217;ve collaborated with people. And the mere fact of doing that, and being a good custodian, means that now everybody knows them. If I want this kind of thing that they offer, I&#8217;m going to at least consider what they&#8217;ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, on the other hand, I&#8217;ve also come across situations where the opposite has happened. As you said, people have built things, come into the WordPress space, and sort of misjudged a little bit about how that would work, and very much hard sell, and what have you. Again, I have an intuition that that doesn&#8217;t work out for the best. And you may have your own personal experiences about that, where people have approached you, and wish to be marketed by you in your newsletter, or whatever it may be, and it just didn&#8217;t feel right somehow. So there&#8217;s a lesson to be learned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:56] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> Exactly. And this is very true for especially SaaS products, or SaaS services that are coming into WordPress ecosystem, targeting WordPress people. I had a interaction, just a normal interaction with someone who built a SaaS service, and they wanted to target WordPress users to come on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the interaction started with like, they were telling me all the features, the fancy features and all that stuff. I&#8217;m saying, yeah, that&#8217;s good. And then I asked the very basic question like, if I&#8217;m a WordPress user, how am I going to integrate your service on my website, right? Oh, we provide a piece of code, and you just slap it there and it&#8217;s done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I said, WordPress people don&#8217;t work like that. You need to have an integration plugin. Oh, we never thought about it. And I said, no, that&#8217;s how WordPress ecosystem works. You&#8217;ve got to have an integration plugin, where a person installs a plugin and your site is connected to your service and it&#8217;s done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those people then went away for six months, without anything, then they came back after six months, emailed me, we got the plugin ready, now what&#8217;s next? And I said, yeah, that&#8217;s the first step actually to, you know, you need to be prepared for your entry into the WordPress ecosystem. You can&#8217;t expect WordPress people, obviously they are developers and all that, but average WordPress person would prefer to install an integration plugin to connect to a service, rather than getting a piece of code, and then look where to paste it, right? I won&#8217;t name that service, but they&#8217;ve been doing pretty good in the ecosystem now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I wonder how difficult it is nowadays to sell into the WordPress space. Because I imagine that if you had a fully functional plugin a decade ago, let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, 12, 13 years ago, the space was far less crowded. And you probably have been around for a while, so everybody knows you. You&#8217;ve become the incumbent, and what have you. You probably don&#8217;t need to do that work of being a part of the community, and showing up to events because you&#8217;ve already done it, and everybody knows who you are, and you are the incumbent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do wonder how fiercely competitive it must be in the WordPress space. Let&#8217;s just pick an example. Let&#8217;s say that I came out with, oh I don&#8217;t know, just random thing, an SEO plugin. And we know that there&#8217;s a bunch of those already, and some of them enormously successful. But you&#8217;ve built the plugin, and it must be hard to then think, gosh, I spend all this time building the plugin. Do I really have to turn up to these things? Do I really have to go and sit through, I don&#8217;t know, watch through Slack channels, and turn up to podcast interviews, and go to events at different points in the world? Can&#8217;t I just sell it? Will somebody not just take it on and make it as success for me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think maybe a decade ago that might have been much more the case. But now I think that piece of the puzzle, if you want to be a real success in the WordPress space, I think given the competition, you have to do a bit of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:38] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> Absolutely, because building a product is just 30%, rest 70% is marketing. And it&#8217;s not just marketing your product, it&#8217;s marketing yourself. You being a founder, co-founder, or a big team, doesn&#8217;t matter. Because if you look closely, be it a big product or a small product, most of the product has a face. Like we know, oh Yoast, I know this person from the Yoast. GoDaddy. I know this person from GoDaddy, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketing is very difficult, but if you do it in a natural way. If you&#8217;re looking for immediate sales, and you are completely new to the ecosystem, and you don&#8217;t have any existing product that can bring repetition to your new product, then it would be difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again, WordPress ecosystem is very welcoming for new people who are ready to mingle, and interact, and share their knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of examples, like you mentioned about SEO plugin. There&#8217;s so many forms plugin. Now, you see WS form. Where did it come up from? Like last few years, it&#8217;s everywhere, right? Why? Because the founder is proactive, and he&#8217;s proactive about sharing stuff, rather than promoting his plugin. Because once you know a person, you always dig out and see, what&#8217;s the end deal here, right? So, I know it sounds very easy. Go and interact in the community, but mind you, it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, okay. That&#8217;s interesting. Where is the community now though? Because I feel there&#8217;s maybe 10 different places that I could mention, where you might find an aspect of the community. I&#8217;ll just rattle a few off. So, WordCamps, WordPress meetups, Facebook groups, Slack channels. You know, if you&#8217;re looking into Trac, you might find something in there. If you&#8217;re into GitHub, you might find something there. There&#8217;s probably all sorts of people on Twitter that you can follow. I&#8217;m on seven and I&#8217;ll stop, because I could keep going. But you get the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any intuition these days, in the year 2024, June 2024? Where would you think a good proportion of that time should go? Is there a plan that you would advise people to follow, or is it just use what you&#8217;re already using, and the things that you&#8217;re already good with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:36] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> You know, in my initial years, Facebook group was the big thing. Like I was in so many Facebook group. And not just I learned and made connections in Facebook group, even my agency business got like 99.99% of referrals and clients from those Facebook groups. And those were amazing. I&#8217;m still part of few Facebook groups, and they are still amazing, and I love them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again, I personally have stopped investing my time, or I should say bulk of my time interacting, because I&#8217;m already in various other systems now. Last one or two years, I&#8217;ve been enjoying Twitter and LinkedIn more, in connecting with new people. Because if you see, person you will find on LinkedIn would not be there on Facebook. That person may or may not be on Twitter. So the thing is, now there&#8217;s so much fragmentation of platforms, and there&#8217;s one person who would love to be on one platform, one person would love to be on another platform. So you need to be, just to cater to that needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I have a Facebook page for the WP Weekly on Facebook, right? But there&#8217;s always someone who said, I can&#8217;t tag you on LinkedIn. What&#8217;s the idea? So I had to launch a page for WP Weekly on LinkedIn, even though it&#8217;s an extra work for me. But again, if you want to spread your impact, spread your whole ecosystem, then you have to be on different platforms. Again, this is a time consuming thing, but whether you want to look at it as a time consuming thing, or investment, that&#8217;s how the whole perspective of thing goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you are starting new in 2024, Facebook groups is still one of the best place to start interacting. But again, you have to be little careful. It&#8217;s not like, oh hello, I&#8217;m this, this is my product, go buy it. That&#8217;s not how you introduce yourself in Facebook group. That still holds true even in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow people on Twitter, which is X now. Twitter has been amazing in the last two or three years for me. Like I&#8217;ve learned so many things. I&#8217;ve interacted with a lot of people there. Yes, the issue is that it&#8217;s a real time, you know, learning and communication. You can&#8217;t dig into archives and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, the only thing that I&#8217;ve dropped off on my radar is Slack channels, various Slack. Because again, I personally found it too difficult because it&#8217;s a real time thing. People pings in, and you leave everything, and then attend it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m only in part of two Slack channel, one is the Make WordPress Slack official, if someone tags and all that. And the other one is like a private slack of just five people. Five WordPress people who share things other than WordPress, because you need that fun element also in your online life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of interesting, your path is quite similar to mine, in that I&#8217;ve ebbed and flowed. And things that I was really into for a period of time, I&#8217;ve become more disinterested in. Coincidentally, Facebook is one of them. But I&#8217;ve also found that I&#8217;m much more active in the Slack channels, than I ever was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I forgot to mention that. That is, if you can cope with the UI of Slack, and the linear nature of everything in one thread, which is, it can be quite hard if you blink, or go away for a week and come back, can be a challenge to catch up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But essentially there&#8217;s no right answer. But what was kind of curious about what you said there was, there is an etiquette sometimes. There is a way of behaving, especially at the beginning. Where, if you show up to, let&#8217;s say one of the Facebook groups, and you join and you get accepted and all that, and you immediately start hitting that Facebook group with obvious sales and promotional content, it&#8217;s kind of interesting the reaction that you can have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas if you posted that exact same post two years after you&#8217;ve been in that community, and you&#8217;ve been really helpful, and you&#8217;ve obviously been a good citizen, and you are kind of now owed by the group, if you like. That&#8217;s the wrong way of describing it, but you know what I mean. You&#8217;ve put so much in, that maybe it&#8217;s time to get something back. That sort of stuff seems to be a little bit different. So, you do have to learn the rules of the road for each of these communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like Twitter&#8217;s more broadcast. It&#8217;s more, hit a button and just say what you want to say, and if you wish to reply, so be it. But the Facebook groups and things like that, there is much more commentary, and things going on, so that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:39] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> That&#8217;s why I tell people, make friends. If the owner of Facebook group is your friend, you can get away with a lot of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s interesting, yeah. So not everybody&#8217;s going to succeed, right? You may have a product to service, and you build it, and despite all of that, despite all of the efforts that you make, you show up to events, you participate, it just somehow never finds its way. That product was never destined to be a success, and it wasn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you say about this? Do you think that it&#8217;s okay in WordPress to pivot, if you&#8217;ve been doing something for a long time? Is there anything in that? Just keep trying. It&#8217;s a worthwhile community. So instead of saying, okay, that plugin didn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;m going to abandon WordPress, and I&#8217;m going to go and build something for Shopify, or just build a SaaS app. Do you think that WordPress is a place where you can have a number of goes, even if the first few are failures?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:25] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> You know, if you dig the history of founders, or co-founders of very popular plugins in the current times, you will be surprised to know that plugin is, or was, not their first plugin. They had so many failures, so-called failures. I don&#8217;t call it as a failure, I call it as a learning step, learning process. Every failure, or everything that didn&#8217;t work is a learning, there&#8217;s a learning in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I have to give my example, besides running an agency, I ran a theme shop that worked for me, and that really did wonders. I used to sell custom Genesis themes. It worked really well. Obviously Genesis ecosystem has gone in 10 years now, so that is not a relevant project. But I&#8217;ve done so many, so many projects that did not work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s a difference between me at that time and now. Like, earlier I used to cling to my projects. No, it&#8217;s going to work. I&#8217;m going to stick with it for three, four years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now I have a strict timeline. If that thing does not work, or I&#8217;m not interested in that thing for one year, I&#8217;m going to put it in a snooze mode, and get onto something that I might be interested in doing something else, right? So if you launch 10 different things, don&#8217;t expect even two of them working, it would be mostly one or zero. That&#8217;s how real life works, even in WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re launching a plugin expecting, oh, I&#8217;m going to make triple, or four or five figures in one year, don&#8217;t even have the target. First step is launch a plugin for free, the free version. Because, again, if you see the WordPress ecosystem, the free model to the pro model, that&#8217;s the golden journey of even a customer, and even for you as an entrepreneur of a product. Obviously there are plugins which are pro only, and still work. But if you notice, those are mostly plugins that are like five or 10 years old, when the ecosystem was pretty much different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, one curious thing that came out of that was that, you&#8217;ve had things that were successful. You just described things where it was a failure, and so you move on because you can&#8217;t keep sustaining a failing idea, or a failing product forever. But also, you said that you&#8217;d had things which were successful, and you mentioned themes and Genesis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;ve been in the WordPress space for any length of time, you&#8217;ll know that Genesis was all the rage. There was this theme called Genesis, and there were loads of things built on top of it. It almost became like a default for a significant amount of the community. And then, fast forward 5, 10 years, it had gone away. Other things had come along, usurped its place in the marketplace. We were talking about other themes and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s interesting as well. Your success might not always be a success, and you have to be open to that as well. You know, just because you once were doing gangbuster sales, doesn&#8217;t mean that you always will. So be prepared to let go of an idea which worked, but maybe isn&#8217;t working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:13] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> Yeah, move with the times. Because if you see the WordPress ecosystem, it changes every two, three years. The popular themes, the popular plugins, they all change within two, three years. That&#8217;s like mostly the shelf life. When I say change, it&#8217;s just them being in the popularity bracket, and then being removed from popularity bracket, and tagged as legacy, or the old school kind of products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, move with the times. Because, again, even if you see the page builder stuff, that&#8217;s like the most hotly contested topic, there&#8217;s a new page builder who are all the rage. People use it, but not everyone uses it. There are people who still use the old page builders, and it works for them. But there&#8217;s a section of audience who loves to jump on new products. But then there&#8217;s a section of old people like me, maybe you also, who stick to the old products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because my school of thought is like, if the product that you&#8217;re using is working on foundational level, there&#8217;s no reason to change it immediately. Because if you change a product, it&#8217;s not just changing a product, it&#8217;s changing the whole learning process around it. And then, you know, if you&#8217;re serving client website, you&#8217;re rebuilding the whole thing. So be smart there. It&#8217;s good to follow the buzz in the ecosystem, but don&#8217;t get carried away with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I do think that&#8217;s really interesting because, I mean, obviously if you have a really successful product in the WordPress space, then it does make sense to just invest all of your time and efforts into that one thing, because clearly that&#8217;s working. And we know that there are companies out there who, for decades or more have focused on one thing, and it&#8217;s been really successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, interesting that in the back of your mind, is always the thought of, what&#8217;s the next thing? What could I be doing next, just in case? So you&#8217;ve, kind of got this insurance policy idea really that, you know, I&#8217;ve got a kernel of an idea, and it&#8217;s just sitting in the back there, and if I notice that this thing declines, then I&#8217;ll start to operate on that. And I think that&#8217;s a very sensible approach to take. So that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:59] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> You know, having multiple streams of revenue in this time, or any time in the WordPress space, is very critical. Because, if you have two or three different places that is bringing or generating revenue for you, they will always fluctuate. But when you have multiple, they will all compensate with each other. And then you end up making the same amount of revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a person working in a WordPress product company as an employee wants to launch a new plugin, or new product of their own. By default, hunch of a human nature is, I&#8217;m going to leave the job, and I&#8217;m start working on a product, and I&#8217;m going to sell it. That sounds very interesting. That sounds very, very attractive. But in real life, that can be a disaster for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the best idea is, yes, work on a product while you&#8217;re working on a job. Find a free time, and run it in parallel, and validate it, whether it&#8217;s going to work or not. Because you don&#8217;t want to come from a hundred to zero. Come from a hundred to 70, and then try to experiment things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s really nice advice. Fascinating conversation. So the WordPress community is big, broad, there&#8217;s lots of success. There&#8217;s probably a fair amount of failure as well. But I think the lasting message from here is keep trying, keep pivoting, be a good member of the community, explore the different ways that the community operates. Figure out what the rules of the road are, and hopefully you&#8217;ll have some success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davinder, where do we connect with you? I mean, I know you mentioned the platform specifically. I think Twitter and LinkedIn are your favorites at the moment. But I know that you&#8217;ve got a newsletter. We mentioned it at the beginning. So, anywhere that you want to tell people to go to find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:27] <strong>Davinder Singh Kainth:</strong> My username is, I, I as an iPhone, followed by Davinder, D-A-V-I-N-D-E-R. I&#8217;m iDavinder on every platform, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook. And also I have a website called iDavinder.com, which is a legacy, old, vintage looking website, which needs a makeover, you know? Own websites never get loved, but I plan to redo it someday. So yeah, iDavinder, I&#8217;m happy, say hi, happy to connect with, I love connecting with new people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Perfect. So we will put all of that into the show notes, along with the links to the WP Weekly as well. And it just remains for me to say, Davinder Singh Kainth, thank you very much for chatting to me today.

Welcome back to the Next Generation with Sophia DeRosia and Allison Dye. Today our special guest is Bud Kraus. Bud, do you want to say hi?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />Hello everybody, and thank you for having me on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />We were just talking with Bud, who was wondering why our first guest is him because, as he said himself, &#8220;I am the oldest person there is for the Next Gen podcast. Why me?&#8221; Sophia and I talked about how everyone was young once and everyone was in a similar position to what we are in now. Every generation has its differences. We may have different-looking obstacles than the ones you faced, but in the end, we face similar challenges. As you have gotten older, you&#8217;re facing similar challenges again in a way. We all face ageism in the workplace: &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re too young,&#8221; or &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re too old.&#8221; In tech, there seems to be this idea that you have to be this perfect ever-young age, but not too young. Do you want to talk a little bit about that experience and maybe compare it to when you were younger and older? Do you see similarities with those two periods of your life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />Well, you call to my mind that when I was your age, I didn&#8217;t have any idea what I wanted to do. All of this technology, the internet, the web, all that was not around, of course. It was very hard to find my way in the world. In fact, I worked in a totally different industry for 17 years waiting for all of this to begin. Once it did begin, I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s where I want to go.&#8221; But you&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re either too old or too young, and maybe you&#8217;re just right for a couple of years when you think about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />So what made you change from that career of 17 years to doing something entirely different?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />This is really important because, as people will see over a period of time, they will change their careers multiple times whether they want to or not. The world being what it is will force you to. I think part of my story is to take charge of that and not let events and changes take charge of you. It&#8217;s easier said than done, I understand that, but that&#8217;s something that you should keep in mind. I was actually an insurance broker in New York City, and my clients were in the entertainment industry, so that was all good. Over time, I just grew to hate the insurance industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first saw the web in 1994, I said, &#8220;How do they do that?&#8221; This was at a time when websites were gray backgrounds, black text, blue links, and maybe a few gifs, and that was about it. I was fascinated by what I was looking at. I think I was looking at a Hungarian library website or something, and I just said, &#8220;I want to do that.&#8221; Of course, I didn&#8217;t know what &#8220;that&#8221; was. It took me quite a while to figure out what that was. In the beginning, it was just making websites. If you went to somebody and said, &#8220;I can make a website for you,&#8221; they either said, &#8220;Great,&#8221; or &#8220;What&#8217;s a website?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s how I got started. Then I realized shortly thereafter that I was not really much of a designer. I had no experience. So what do you do if you can&#8217;t do anything? You start teaching, right? I found myself teaching in businesses and at Pratt Institute and FIT in New York City. I was teaching HTML and CSS and then eventually WordPress. That was really my first love. Well, my wife is, and then teaching, and then my kids. Alright, let&#8217;s get the family out of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But education is really the first thing that I really like to do, and I&#8217;m always learning new things myself. I think that&#8217;s really important for anybody at any stage: to keep your mind open to the possibilities of growing and learning. We&#8217;re all going to be lifelong learners. You want to make that very much a part of your life. The idea that you&#8217;re going to be learning the rest of your life, you&#8217;re going to want to and embrace it. Embrace that challenge of learning all your life. If you look at the WordPress community, the people there really embrace the idea of lifelong learning from a very young age to well, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I once talked to a president of a college in New Hampshire, and we were talking about the idea of changing careers. She said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re going to switch jobs 20 times in your life. You&#8217;re going to switch careers 20 times in your life.&#8221; But you see, here&#8217;s the beauty of that kind of thing. You might think that there&#8217;s no connection between being an insurance broker and working in web design. Oh, wrong. You couldn&#8217;t be more hopelessly wrong because the skills I learned in business—negotiating contracts, insurance, accounting—whatever I learned, I could bring that all into my new world, and I did. Those 17 years, while they weren&#8217;t my happiest years, certainly taught me a lot to bring forward into what I do today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a lot of very good mentors in those days. If you&#8217;re a younger person, you want to find mentors to take you under their wing and help you navigate the world. In your early twenties, you&#8217;re still kind of raw. Sorry, you&#8217;re not a finished product. I guess I am a finished product. Of course, I change, but I pretty much am who I am. When you&#8217;re in your early twenties, you want to take the advice of somebody who&#8217;s been around, who knows how to deal with people, who knows what to say, and who understands what you do and don&#8217;t do. I was very fortunate in the insurance business to have about two and a half tremendous mentors. The lessons I learned from them I practice today. So if I&#8217;m 25 or 30, I&#8217;m definitely looking for somebody who will, in a certain way, have my back and look after me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />That is something that I found as well. The start of my career has been absolutely left and right, zigzag. Nothing has been what I thought it would be, but I have learned an incredible amount that will last me. Not even just about jobs, but about life things. I&#8217;ve learned a lot from coworkers and employers and all these things that I definitely never thought I would learn from where I&#8217;m at, but I&#8217;m very grateful for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />Absolutely. We were just talking about this the other day, Sophia, about how I worked as a nanny for a long time, and then I ended up in sales. I was like, &#8220;Oh, everyone, no matter the age, can have a tantrum.&#8221; You learn these skills along the way, and even though they may not seem connected at the time, they do connect at some point. They do feed into what you&#8217;re doing next, regardless of if they&#8217;re related or not. So I think that&#8217;s a really important thing to keep in mind no matter what age we are. It&#8217;s maybe only in movies where you start on one career path and stay on the same path the entire time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />Something that we have yet to see is people retiring from internet or WordPress jobs. We&#8217;re jumping into this world with really no expectation of what it&#8217;s supposed to look like or what it&#8217;s going to look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />Well, that&#8217;s a ways for you guys to go. The whole concept of retirement is changing and will be radically different in 40 years. You can be sure of that. It might be radically different in the next four minutes. Who knows? But Allison, I have a question about sales. Are you in sales now? What do you sell?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />No, I was in sales for a time at a WordPress agency selling WordPress services. It was interesting to see the skills that I didn&#8217;t quite expect to come in handy when they did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />My point is that I think everybody along the line should or probably will take some kind of position in sales because I think sales is the number one of all the things that we do in the business world. If there are no sales, there&#8217;s nothing else. To me, it&#8217;s the most important job. They are all important, but sales make the world go round. Without commerce, which is sales, we don&#8217;t really have much for business. So no matter what we do in life, we are going to be selling ourselves, a service, or something else. That&#8217;s really important. I always felt most people get to the point in sales when they&#8217;re not selling, that&#8217;s when they&#8217;re the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />When they&#8217;re not sitting around going, &#8220;I got to sell this.&#8221; There are all kinds of techniques. I&#8217;ve seen all kinds of different salespeople. I&#8217;ve been exposed to some tremendous salespeople, which I don&#8217;t claim to be. I&#8217;m sort of average. But the people I&#8217;ve been exposed to were tremendous. That&#8217;s the kind of thing you want to learn from as many people as you can. I was very fortunate to see a lot of really great salespeople.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />Well, and sales isn&#8217;t even just commerce or money. It&#8217;s learning how to sell yourself, how to present yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />Well, it&#8217;s convincing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s communicating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />And that can take you very, very far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />Yeah. I always saw one of the common threads of people who are really good salespeople is that you, as the buyer, want to do business with them. They&#8217;re fun, they&#8217;re interesting, they&#8217;re exciting, they&#8217;re silly, they&#8217;re whatever, and they&#8217;re knowledgeable. You can&#8217;t be just a joke; you have to know your product and service. But what makes it different, one from another, is maybe the price, whatever. It&#8217;s just, I would say, &#8220;Oh, I love that guy. I want to work with him. I want to do business with him.&#8221; To me</p>\n\n\n\n<p>, that was always a huge advantage if you had that personality. A lot of salespeople do have that A-type personality. I have an F-type personality, whatever. They don&#8217;t even have a scale for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />I would love to know what similarities you see having been really young in the tech space versus now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />Well, I wasn&#8217;t really young. I was in my early forties when I decided no more insurance. I wanted to be in the industry of my time. Now, I didn&#8217;t think that then, but I think that&#8217;s what makes what we do, or being in the WordPress community, so special. We are in the industry of our time. If it was 1940, we&#8217;d be making cars. It&#8217;s just more exciting. It&#8217;s more relevant and important to people&#8217;s lives. I just found that to be… What was your question? You&#8217;re lucky if you can be that way. Going back to what Sophia said, you can expect, especially in the early years, that your career will zigzag. Unless you&#8217;re like my son who knew when he was 10 years old what he wanted to do, that&#8217;s a blessing. It really is. My wife is that way too. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that we&#8217;re cursed if we don&#8217;t know. It just means that our path is going to be a little different, maybe a little rockier, but in some ways more adventurous and unpredictable. That can definitely be unsettling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />Builds character.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />But also rewarding. Only through time can you look back and say, &#8220;Oh,&#8221; and make some kind of observation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />Tell us about your kids a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />I have two children, a son who&#8217;s older than you guys and a daughter who&#8217;s older than you guys. Fortunately, they were raised by my wife. That&#8217;s not to say I wasn&#8217;t around, but I did too many wrong things as a dad, quite frankly. She did all the right things. Fortunately, they turned out more like her than like me. But that&#8217;s okay. They&#8217;re not WordPress or tech people per se, although we&#8217;re all in tech in one way or another. Just because you&#8217;re not in WordPress doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not in tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what is really special right now is my grandboys. Today I&#8217;m wearing a hat that they gave me for Father&#8217;s Day, which says &#8220;Papa Buddy.&#8221; I have a grandson who&#8217;s three and a half, and another one who&#8217;s 14 months. They&#8217;re just like medicine. My mother said grandchildren are the dessert of life. Well, I&#8217;m getting overstuffed on dessert. In fact, my oldest grandson went to his mother the other day and said, &#8220;Papa acts like a baby.&#8221; And she told me. So I go back to my grandson and say, &#8220;I heard you think I act like a baby.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were talking earlier before we started recording about transitioning. There&#8217;s this guy named Bob Dunn. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard of Bob. Maybe not. Most people…not sure. Most people don&#8217;t know who he is. I remember I met him at a WordCamp Philadelphia. It was prearranged, like a prearranged marriage. That&#8217;s a whole other story that I don&#8217;t want to get into. We had a really long talk, and one of the things Bob said really impressed me. He said, &#8220;If you&#8217;re doing something and it doesn&#8217;t work, then do something else. Don&#8217;t keep trying to fix something that probably isn&#8217;t worth fixing.&#8221; If you look at Bob&#8217;s trajectory, he&#8217;s really the embodiment of that, and I am too, becoming an embodiment of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I was doing something in my work, like web design, and eventually I came to understand, it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like it. I love the craft, but I hated dealing with waiting for clients to make a decision or send me deliverables. I realized I had to sort of retarget. I wasn&#8217;t conscious of this, but a few years ago, I started saying, &#8220;I have all these connections in the WordPress community, but they&#8217;re not really doing me any good.&#8221; By that, I meant I couldn&#8217;t make any money off of these guys. It&#8217;s really nice to know all these people, but I just can&#8217;t make a dollar from them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then one thing led to the next, and Vikas from InstaWP said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you make a video for me?&#8221; And that&#8217;s how it started. I realized, &#8220;Oh, I could create content for WordPress businesses and leverage my connections with the WordPress community and web hosts.&#8221; That&#8217;s where I am today and where I will be now until the end, because I love doing it. It is the right thing for me to do. The only web projects I do now are if they beg me and it has to be a perfect fit. It&#8217;s not going to be a startup. It&#8217;s not doing any of that stuff. You have to have an ongoing business that needs work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was recently begged to get involved with something, literally, because I don&#8217;t want to go through the working-on-the-website journey anymore unless it fits my needs. Now I&#8217;m in a position where I can do that. If I&#8217;m 25 years old, I may not be in a position to do that. You&#8217;re going to take jobs and gigs and do stuff that you&#8217;re going to look back on and go, &#8220;Oh God, I did that for money.&#8221; But that&#8217;s okay because even though you did it for money and it might have been a sort of waste of time or a painful experience, only over time will you see that maybe it wasn&#8217;t so bad. Maybe it was pretty good because it led you to think, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to do that again.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are absolutely going to take work that you have to take, and it&#8217;s okay to do that. But hopefully, when you reach the grand old age of… you can say, &#8220;I&#8217;m only going to do what I want to do.&#8221; At my age, if you&#8217;re working, you hopefully don&#8217;t want to do stuff you don&#8217;t want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />I think there&#8217;s a lot of value in learning what not to do as well. There are a lot of things that you learn in your twenties, like &#8220;Oh, I never want to be like that manager,&#8221; or &#8220;I really don&#8217;t like doing this.&#8221; It is just a lot of trial and error to figure out what those things are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />Absolutely. Especially at your age, keep your mind open to learning new things and new directions. If you&#8217;re going to work in the WordPress space, you already have the connections, the experience, and the exposure to move forward if that&#8217;s the direction you want to go in. I never had a network like I have now in the WordPress space when I was in the insurance industry. Things were different then. We didn&#8217;t have the ability to connect like we do today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />You had to send carrier pigeons to each other across town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />You got it. I mean, that&#8217;s about what it was. Imagine a world that didn&#8217;t have fax machines. Forget about email and computers. We couldn&#8217;t even send a fax to somebody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />That&#8217;s wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />Everything moved at a much slower pace. For some people, that&#8217;s good. I think today things work too fast. My daughter, who&#8217;s a little older than you guys, is very fearful of the rapid change we go through all the time. Things that would take 10 years to change now take six months. It&#8217;s very hard for people to adapt. Even young people, I think, if I&#8217;m 25, what am I going to do with AI? How am I going to work with AI? How am I going to get better at working with AI than anybody else? Because that&#8217;s your challenge. How do I work with it? It&#8217;s only going to grow in importance in our lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though I am my age, I look at things as if I were 25. Maybe that&#8217;s why I am the first guest that you had, because why would they choose me? Come on. But I try to see things as a younger person would see and adapt. I&#8217;m learning new things, and that&#8217;s the whole key: not just to settle and say, &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason for me to learn how to create a custom block. I&#8217;m not a developer. I&#8217;m not going to be one. Why should I learn?&#8221; The answer is, I&#8217;m trying to learn because I want to know more about the process. What do developers go through? Maybe I could actually do something. I&#8217;m not going to relearn stuff I already know. I&#8217;m going to push myself to learn more. Even if you say, &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean anything to me now,&#8221; you don&#8217;t know that in 5, 6, 7 years, the thing you&#8217;re learning today may be the reason why you get that job. Learning is really number one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>God, I wish I had known all this stuff when I was 25. I say that all the time. Boy, I wish I was, but I wasn&#8217;t. Only through life… I would say things like, &#8220;If I was 25, I&#8217;d ask her out on a date.&#8221; When I was 25, I don&#8217;t think I had kissed anybody. You just change. If you&#8217;re lucky like me to have lived as long as I have, you get to my stage, and you hopefully say, &#8220;This is the best time of my life.&#8221; A lot of people say, &#8220;When you&#8217;re old, you&#8217;re going to die.&#8221; Okay, I get it. But why not make this time the best time of your life? Quite frankly, the roughest times are the earliest times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why your show is important because you have the opportunity to help others understand that, hey, you&#8217;re not alone. We&#8217;re here, and these are the things that we think we can help you with. I&#8217;m speaking on your behalf, obviously, which I do a lot. But you really have that opportunity to help not just the younger generation but any generation move forward. Maybe they&#8217;re looking for inspiration, looking for ways to better themselves, improve their career prospects, things like that</p>\n\n\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />What I really admire about you is that you are surrounded by younger people, whether they be toddlers or your kids. I think that does help give you a different perspective on things. I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />When you&#8217;re my age, almost everybody is younger, but that&#8217;s not the point. I am so fortunate to have you guys in my life and people like you. Whereas I talk to people my age and their circle of friends and influence gets smaller and smaller, mine keeps going the other way. It&#8217;s not supposed to be that way. Well, why not? Why can&#8217;t I grow? Why can&#8217;t I meet new people? I&#8217;m not ready for a nursing home where I&#8217;m going to see the same 10 gray hairs all day long. I have a lot of friends who are my age and older who just watch TV, play golf, and read books. Nothing wrong with that, but if that&#8217;s all you do…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />You get tired of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />For whatever it is, I&#8217;m just attracted to new ideas, new thoughts, new people, new everything. A lot of people my age are just done. I think it&#8217;s very important. I like to do what I&#8217;m doing, let&#8217;s just say. If you&#8217;re really fortunate, you get to this stage of life, and you&#8217;ll say, &#8220;These are the best years of my life.&#8221; If I was 25 and I heard that, I&#8217;d go, &#8220;Huh, you&#8217;re so old. How could this be the best time of your life?&#8221; Well, you can make it. I&#8217;ve made it the best time of my life. I worked at it. I thought about what to do to make it the best time of my life. I changed over the last recent years to make it the best time. It wasn&#8217;t just a straight trajectory. It got better every year. There are certain things that happened along the way, particularly in the last five or six years, that got me to the point where…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons, it&#8217;s pretty obvious, is Bob Dunn. He gave me the courage to realize if I was doing something in my work that wasn&#8217;t working, then find something else to do. He&#8217;s living proof of it. I&#8217;m becoming living proof of it too. That&#8217;s such good advice for anybody at any stage. Chances are if you&#8217;re doing something that is not working, you&#8217;re miserable or you&#8217;re not as happy as you should be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />Absolutely. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />So I&#8217;m a Bob Dunn disciple. Alright. Enough of this. Bob, who is this guy? Who is this guy anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />We should start making t-shirts with his face on them. We can all pass them around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />He&#8217;s liable to want me to be one of his hosts. No, I don&#8217;t think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />Maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />No, I doubt it. We know that&#8217;s not going to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />No. But I love how you surround yourself with lots of people of different ages. I think it keeps your perspective open to everything. I love your attitude towards life, a continual learning journey. I really admire that. We all need to embrace that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />Yeah, it is really, I think, the key to happiness in this world. I think it&#8217;s the key to staying relevant, current, useful, productive, whatever. There is no other way to do this. The world is changing so fast that if you don&#8217;t grow with it, then you are going to be left behind, and chances are you&#8217;re not going to be very happy about that. Isn&#8217;t it about being happy? When you think about it, somebody&#8217;s always going to have more money, more clothes, more this, more that, whatever. If that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re chasing, you&#8217;re never going to be happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />I feel like that&#8217;s something that, Allison, you and I have learned through our unschooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />School looked different. Sometimes school looked like going to the library and getting a bunch of shark books, learning about what you enjoyed at the time. Who knows why sharks might be valuable, but you&#8217;re going to learn everything there is to know about sharks and have the best time doing it. It teaches you how to learn and encourages you to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />See, that&#8217;s so important, Sophia: how to learn. The fact that you were homeschooled and learned how to learn, well, that&#8217;s fabulous. How to learn is really to learn. Maybe that&#8217;s a problem with a lot of people: they just don&#8217;t know how to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />Or even where to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />And everybody learns in a different way. So obviously you have to learn your way, but how to learn is crucial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />Yeah, absolutely. It was great talking with you today, Bud. I admire that you surround yourself with people of all ages, that you never stop learning, and that your message for everyone is to make the life you want. You can change it. You can change your career, you can change your job, you can change your routine, you can change what you want to learn. I love that, and I think it&#8217;s applicable to everyone of all ages. I really appreciate you sharing that with us today. How can people find you on the internet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />You can find me anywhere…well, not anywhere, but first of all, I&#8217;m on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and whatever. I have a website. Actually, I have two. One is Joy of WP—not Joy of WordPress. It&#8217;s Joyofwp.com. This is my business site where I talk about and demonstrate the things that I do for clients, creating WordPress content for WordPress businesses. Then I have this podcast called Seriously Bud, where I interview a person from the WordPress community each week. It comes out every Friday. I also have a newsletter. If you go to seriouslybud.com, you can see and listen to all the past episodes. Currently, there are 15. It&#8217;s just been a joy to do that podcast and continues to be. Sophia DeRosia has appeared on that, as well as Cate DeRosia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />I have the first family of WordPress, and I have this Topher guy. Eventually, I&#8217;ll have him on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />Eventually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />That&#8217;s also been part of my transition and journey: creating that podcast. It&#8217;s just been fantastic. SeriouslyBud.com, don&#8217;t forget to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />Awesome. Thank you so much, Bud. And thank you, Sophia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sophia:<br />Oh yeah. Thank you, Allison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud:<br />Thank you, ladies, for letting me do this, and good luck on your journey to do something that&#8217;s really important not just for the Next Gen but for all generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allison:<br />Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of A<strong><em>ll Things WordPress and WooCommerce, The Next Generation</em></strong>, hosts <strong>Sophia DeRosia</strong> and <strong>Allison Dye</strong> sit down with <strong>Bud Kraus</strong> from <strong>Joy of WP</strong> and the podcast, <strong>Seriously Bud</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud shares his unique journey from being an insurance broker to becoming a known figure in the WordPress community.

of my existence: HIV and AIDS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the end of 1980s and despite still being a child, I felt that AIDS-related advertisements on TV were projected more to scare than to give explanations about a disease, so continuing to ask uneasy questions to family members and teachers, by the time I was 13 I had already realized that dividing people into &#8220;right&#8221;

and judged by my teachers; in fact, I always had very low grades in written expositions in which I was asked to talk about myself; it was different, however, if current events were discussed or, better yet, if I had to use my fantasy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my teens I wrote a lot of stories and unfortunately I was unable to preserve the material, paper Braille does not last long and gets ruined, and so do floppy disks &#8211; early magnetic media for computers; then came CDs but transferring the material to those media did not allow me to edit files in them and I instead wanted my most important fictional character, the sentient HIV virus that speaks to humans, to grow with me so editing and rewriting were essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-advent-of-blogging\">The advent of blogging</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Late 1990s. Mail, chat, forums, and newsgroups were already allowing me to be a world’s active participant more than I had ever done before: no barriers in discussing topics from the funniest to the most difficult, including politics, even without necessarily talking about my visual disability. A dream was coming true!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>But how to open a personal space in which to expose myself without obeying rules written by others?&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I had learned how to build my first websites in HTML but maintaining all that code, and asking sighted people for help with graphics, had become an unsustainable commitment. Until I read about some platforms where people wrote a personal journal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From splinder to blogspot, then live journal, there were quite a few but none gave me full satisfaction because the web was beginning to suffer from what later came to be called sensory barriers, resulting in the nullification of the &#8220;universal web&#8221; utopia; they were more concerned with having a pretty, colorful interface rather than an easy-to-use platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-welcome-wordpress\">Welcome WordPress!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the year 2004 and I had learned about a system that allowed me to create my own blog, in my website it was only necessary to buy space, it was even possible to choose the custom interface.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was called WordPress and an Italian community composed of volunteers with passions equal to mine was beginning to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was my chance, I would be able to discuss with a proper community and really collaborate to raise awareness and overcome accessibility obstacles; I got in touch with <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/wolly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Paolo </a><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/wolly/\">Valenti known as Wolly</a>, the first to bring WordPress in Italy.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>An extraordinary person who died in 2022 because of cancer. He always struggled for life and so he did for WordPress so if I am where I am now, it’s thanks to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time he’s always urged me to persevere, never completely abandon WordPress despite the obstacles I might have encountered; and there were many barriers then, because since 2004 when I started my first site about songs and audio editing, my relationship with WordPress has been quite conflicted because of a visual editor that was creating difficulties rather than helping me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to mention themes, where you had to work on code any time you had to modify a small detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I accepted the compromise of building a site with questionable graphics, and I went on like this for a few years: having exhausted my interest in blogging about audio, I had started one in which I shared my experiences with the game of chess, use and abuse of technology, book reviews, joys and sorrows of my personal life including the possibility of starting again with HIV and AIDS activism because in the meantime my former boyfriend, less comfortable with technology than me, had expressed a desire to blog about his experiences as a person living with HIV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Too bad about the editor which still, in the years 2009-2018, was complicated for me and I had to write articles by hand with HTML view instead of GUI view, and if I found it uncomfortable let alone him who had no knowledge of web languages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blog concerning HIV was a failure, but together we had recorded a video talking about our experience on an Italian YouTube channel where they talk about sex education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, on the personal blog I was posting more and more infrequently some articles about my technological frustrations, including the one due to pay TV services that do not pay enough attention to the needs of people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-zero-to-the-atom\">From zero to the atom</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019 all hell broke loose: relationship ended after 10 years, other unpleasant events happened to me one after another, I was brain drained; until one day an email came from a person with HIV who wanted to contact me to talk about the video I made together with my ex, but looking for information about me he found the personal blog with the article concerning pay TV!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there a solid friendship was born and we call ourselves the electron and proton of the same atom, having different opposite points but a lot of common interests including a passion for making up fantasy stories! We were born. Elettrona and Gifter; just needed to decide where to publish and most importantly what.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-talking-virus-get-mine\">Talking virus? Get mine!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex &#8220;Gifter&#8221; and I had just seen See, a TV series where blindness was the norm while sight was considered an exception &#8211; a dystopian story where an epidemic had altered people&#8217;s genetics depriving them of sight. With the due exception of a man born sighted after centuries of human beings born blind&#8230;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by that storyline, we set out to consider the idea of a setting where, opposite to reality, the ordinary condition was living with HIV while those who do not have the virus in their blood deserve to be ostracized by other humans after HIV itself has decided, in its own unquestionable judgment, to reject those who are too violent, rude, selfish or abusive to humans or animals according to virus’s own taste.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>This fantasy world is aimed at creating greater empathy toward people with HIV: if you, HIV-negative, are offended because a fictional HIV-positive character calls you &#8220;empty box,&#8221; let alone how a person living with the virus in the real world feels when they are called a &#8220;pest,&#8221; &#8220;toxic,&#8221;, “dirty” or other discriminatory terms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>My greatest satisfaction was telling Alex about the talking virus as a subject I had been writing about since at least 1996, and he responded by giving me a big smile: &#8220;If you want to make a virus talk, let it be mine! But with what microphone?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-choice-name-and-setup\">The choice: name and setup</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With Alex &#8220;Gifter&#8221; who knows nothing about the web except what he learned from me, it was difficult to choose how to make the site work and we switched from WordPress to Drupal, assuming that the latter would better meet our publishing needs. How wrong we were!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After numerous adventures and backups, the decision was finally made: WordPress, because the editor was improving week by week. Gutenberg was going to be my future, and I didn&#8217;t know it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for the name? The talking virus interacting with humans through music, brotherhood between characters carrying the same HIV strain? Plus Brothers was perfect. So that it would also fit in English.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gutenberg-s-versatility\">Gutenberg’s versatility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Between 2020 and 2021, Gifter and I got busy writing stories and becoming familiar with the various ways to manage WordPress: the mobile app with its block editor, exchanging text documents whose formatting was always lost, until I learned about MarkDown syntax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It didn&#8217;t even seem real to me, Gutenberg supported it almost automatically! I could write very long documents on my tablet or smartphone even from the beach if I wanted to, then transfer them with a simple copy-paste to the website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gifter and I could work together on the same document in plain text without losing formatting as was the case with proprietary formats, and Gutenberg would take care of that later!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-what-s-missing\">WordPress: what’s missing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In years of experience with WordPress I became conscious about how its community tries to cover web accessibility requirements, both in frontend and backend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But unfortunately it’s not the same for themes and plugins. Third-party products developers, commercial and free, in many cases don’t own much expertise on accessibility so installing a component is often a risk; when dealing with a disability it’s frequent to have multiple plugins where a user with no disabilities can just rely on one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is a mixed and messy WordPress backend, made of accessible and inaccessible components that could even require help by a paid expert who makes the changes we are not able to perform on our own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This situation causes frustration for sure, and we have two choices to face it: one is complaining about it with our limited circle of friends, solving the problem on our own or giving up, the other is opening a dialogue with plugins or themes developers to make them aware of accessibility, doing our best to prevent others from living what we experienced.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say that the second option is the best, as community matters and only spreading knowledge and skills can create a better world in the long term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-people-believing-in-me\">People believing in me</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you get familiar with a product, you are pleased in helping others to learn its usage because sharing is caring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First experience has been a blind friend, Roberto, I helped him building his WordPress-based podcast where he shares inclusion stories about other visually impaired people all over the world, and Japanese culture. Motto Podcast &#8211; with &#8220;motto&#8221; as a fusion of two meanings:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Italian: &#8220;motto&#8221; is a slogan used as an encouragement, incentive to do something.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japanese: &#8220;motto&#8221; means &#8220;more&#8221;.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fusion between these two meanings gives &#8220;encouragement to do more&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Motto Podcast&#8217;s first success encouraged me to do even more, so I joined an Italian community called SOS WP to share experiences about WordPress and Gutenberg; that&#8217;s where I met her, Gloria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web designer, WordPress trainer, Gloria Liuni became curious and interested in how I could use computers and smartphones without sight. She wanted to understand the concept of a &#8220;screen reader&#8221; program, how Braille and voice feedback behaved on WordPress, so she gave me the contact information for the first WordCamp I spoke at &#8211; the one in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I demonstrated Gutenberg editor’s usage with the keyboard only, and during that event I learned about the future of WordPress: Gutenberg could break even the last barrier I found to full site customization: themes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It took another two years (and one more WordCamp I spoke at, Verona 2023 this time I attended in person) and I finally took courage: that&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m abandoning the old theme with code and moving to the new Gutenberg based site editor!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An experience that WordPress trainer Gloria and I are having together, because we realized how Gutenberg somehow has the same logic as the programs used by the blind, to interact with computers. I almost feel like I&#8217;m playing with toy bricks, then Gifter with his working eyes tells me if something has gone wrong and Gloria helps me put it right in case of need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, the universal and accessible web is there, the WordPress community is proving it to me day by day, and I am glad to be an active part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"italian\">Sconfiggere silenzio e stigma con WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-chi-sono\">CHI SONO</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sono Elena, italiana, e lavoro nell’accessibilità dei prodotti digitali fin dai primi anni 2000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dalla nascita sono priva della vista e per quanti ostacoli una simile condizione possa portare, la mia solida rete di amici e familiari mi ha consentito fin da subito di sviluppare interessi e curiosità compresa la passione per i polizieschi, che ho messo in pratica nella prima piccola “indagine” della mia esistenza: HIV e AIDS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Era fine anni 80 e malgrado fossi ancora una bambina sentivo che gli slogan mandati in tv fossero costruiti più per far paura che per dare spiegazioni su una malattia, così a forza di chiedere a familiari e insegnanti già a 13 anni avevo capito che dividere le persone tra “giuste” e “sbagliate” non aveva senso perché il virus poteva colpire chiunque.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Così feci una promessa davanti a un poster di Freddie Mercury, e pazienza se non potevo vederlo: giurai che avrei lavorato con ogni mezzo a disposizione affinché più ragazzi possibili avessero accesso alla corretta informazione su HIV e AIDS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>E così è stato, perché al liceo tenevo una rubrica a tema sul giornale scolastico continuando ad aggiornarmi sui progressi scientifici, nel limite delle mie possibilità, anche dopo aver terminato gli studi.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-la-passione-per-la-scrittura\">La passione per la scrittura</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ho sempre odiato svolgere i temi a scuola perché mi facevano sentire “esaminata” e giudicata dai miei insegnanti, infatti avevo sempre voti molto bassi nelle esposizioni scritte in cui mi si invitava a parlare di me; diverso invece era se si discuteva di attualità o, meglio ancora, se dovevo inventare storie.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In adolescenza ho scritto tantissimi racconti e purtroppo non sono riuscita a conservare il materiale, il Braille cartaceo a lungo andare si rovina e così anche i floppy disk &#8211; primi supporti magnetici per computer; poi sono arrivati i cd ma trasferire il materiale su quei supporti non ne consentiva la modifica e io invece desideravo che il mio personaggio di fantasia più importante, il virus HIV senziente che parla agli umani, crescesse con me quindi modifiche e riscrittura erano fondamentali.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-l-avvento-dei-blog\">L’avvento dei blog</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fine anni 90. Mail, chat, forum e newsgroup mi permettevano già di essere parte attiva del mondo come non lo ero mai stata prima: nessuna barriera nel discutere di temi dai più leggeri ai più impegnati, politica compresa, anche senza per forza parlare della mia disabilità visiva. Un sogno che si stava realizzando! Ma come fare ad aprire uno spazio personale in cui esporsi senza obbedire a regole scritte da altri?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avevo imparato a costruire i primi siti web in HTML ma mantenere tutto quel codice, e chiedere aiuto a persone vedenti per la grafica, era diventato un impegno insostenibile. Fino a quando ho letto di alcune piattaforme in cui la gente scriveva un diario personale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Da splinder a blogspot, poi live journal, ce ne erano parecchi ma nessuno mi dava piena soddisfazione perché il web cominciava a soffrire di quelle che poi sono state definite barriere percettive, con conseguente annullamento dell’utopia “web universale”; facevano più attenzione ad avere un’interfaccia carina e colorata, piuttosto di una piattaforma semplice da usare.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-benvenuto-wordpress\">Benvenuto WordPress!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Correva l’anno 2004 e avevo appreso di un sistema che mi consentiva di creare il mio blog, nel mio sito web era sufficiente solo comprare lo spazio, era addirittura possibile scegliere l’interfaccia personalizzata.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Si chiamava WordPress e stava iniziando a svilupparsi una comunità italiana composta di volontari con passioni uguali alle mie.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Era la mia occasione, avrei potuto confrontarmi con gli addetti ai lavori e collaborare davvero per far conoscere e superare gli ostacoli di accessibilità; mi misi in contatto con Paolo Valenti conosciuto come Wolly, il primo a occuparsi di WordPress in Italia e che è morto nel 2022 per un cancro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Una persona straordinaria che ha sempre lottato per la vita e per WordPress quindi se ora sono dove sono, lo devo a lui.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nel tempo mi ha sempre invitato a insistere e non abbandonare mai del tutto WordPress malgrado gli ostacoli che avessi potuto incontrare; all’epoca erano tante le barriere, perché dal 2004 che iniziai il mio primo sito sulle canzoni e la manipolazione audio, il mio rapporto con WordPress è stato parecchio conflittuale a causa di un editor visuale che mi metteva in difficoltà anziché darmi soddisfazioni.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Per non parlare dei temi, che per qualunque banale modifica bisognava mettere le mani sul codice PHP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si sopravviveva con un sito dalla grafica discutibile, e sono andata avanti così per qualche anno: esaurito l’interesse per il blog sull’audio ne avevo aperto uno in cui raccontavo le mie esperienze col gioco degli scacchi, uso e abuso della tecnologia, recensioni di libri, gioie e dolori della mia vita personale inclusa la possibilità di ricominciare con l’attivismo su HIV e AIDS perché nel frattempo il mio ex fidanzato, meno a proprio agio con la tecnologia rispetto a me, aveva espresso il desiderio di condividere in un blog le sue esperienze di persona che vive con HIV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peccato per l’editor che ancora, negli anni 2009-2018, mi era ostico e dovevo scrivere gli articoli a mano con la visualizzazione HTML anziché quella a interfaccia grafica, e se lo trovavo scomodo io figuriamoci lui che non aveva alcuna conoscenza di linguaggi per il web. Progetto HIV e blog sfumato, ma insieme avevamo registrato un video che parlava della nostra esperienza su un canale YouTube italiano dove si parla di educazione sessuale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invece sul blog personale pubblicavo sempre più di rado alcuni articoli sulle mie frustrazioni tecnologiche, compresa quella dovuta ai servizi di tv a pagamento che non pongono sufficiente attenzione alle esigenze delle persone con disabilità.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-da-zero-all-atomo\">Da zero all’atomo</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nel 2019 è successo il finimondo: relazione finita dopo 10 anni, altri eventi spiacevoli uno di seguito all’altro, avevo il cervello svuotato; finché un giorno è arrivata la mail di una persona con HIV che voleva contattarmi per parlare del video fatto assieme al mio ex, ma cercando informazioni su di me ha trovato il blog personale con l’articolo sulle pay tv!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Da qui è nata una solida amicizia e ci definiamo l’elettrone e il protone dello stesso atomo, avendo diversi punti opposti ma un sacco di interessi in comune tra cui la passione per inventare storie di fantasia! Siamo nati noi. Elettrona e Gifter; serviva solo decidere dove pubblicare e soprattutto cosa.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-virus-parlante-prendi-il-mio\">Virus parlante? Prendi il mio!</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Io e Alex “Gifter” avevamo appena visto See, una serie tv in cui la consuetudine era la cecità mentre la vista era considerata un’eccezione &#8211; storia distopica dove un’epidemia aveva modificato la genetica delle persone privandole della vista. Con la dovuta eccezione di un uomo nato vedente dopo secoli di ciechi…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ispirati da quella trama ci siamo messi a valutare l’idea di un’ambientazione in cui, contrariamente alla realtà, la condizione ordinaria fosse vivere con l’HIV mentre chi non ha il virus nel sangue merita di essere emarginato da altri umani dopo che HIV stesso ha deciso, a proprio insindacabile giudizio, di rifiutare chi per i suoi gusti è troppo violento, maleducato, egoista o prevaricatore verso umani o animali.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Questo mondo di fantasia è finalizzato a creare una maggiore empatia verso le persone con HIV: se tu, HIV negativo, ti offendi perché un personaggio HIV positivo finto ti dice “scatola vuota”, figuriamoci come si sente una persona che nel mondo reale vive col virus, quando viene definita “untore”, “tossico” o altri termini discriminatori.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>La mia più grande soddisfazione è stata aver raccontato ad Alex del virus parlante come soggetto su cui scrivevo almeno dal 1996 e lui ha risposto facendomi un grande sorriso: “se vuoi far parlare un virus, lascia che sia il mio! Ma con quale microfono?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-la-scelta-nome-e-ambiente\">La scelta: nome e ambiente</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Con Alex “Gifter” che nulla sa di web salvo ciò che ha imparato da me, era difficile scegliere come muoverci e siamo passati da WordPress a Drupal, credendo che quest’ultimo rispondesse meglio alle nostre esigenze editoriali. Quanto ci sbagliavamo!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dopo numerose avventure e backup, finalmente la decisione è stata presa: WordPress, perché l’editor stava migliorando di settimana in settimana. Gutenberg sarebbe stato il mio futuro e io non lo sapevo ancora.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>E per il nome? Virus parlante che interagisce con gli umani grazie alla musica, fratellanza tra personaggi positivi? Plus Brothers era perfetto. Così da farlo andar bene anche in inglese.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-versatilita-di-gutenberg\">Versatilità di Gutenberg</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tra il 2020 e 2021 io e Gifter ci siamo dati da fare a scrivere storie e prendere confidenza coi vari modi di gestire WordPress: l’app mobile col suo editor a blocchi, scambiarsi documenti di testo la cui formattazione veniva sempre perduta, fino a quando ho conosciuto la sintassi MarkDown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neanche mi sembrava vero, Gutenberg la supportava in modo pressoché automatico! Potevo scrivere un testo molto lungo sul mio tablet o smartphone anche dalla spiaggia volendo, poi trasferirlo con un semplice copia-incolla sul sito web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Io e Gifter potevamo lavorare assieme sullo stesso documento in testo semplice senza perdere la formattazione come succedeva coi formati proprietari e, dopo, ci avrebbe pensato Gutenberg!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-cosa-manca\">WordPress: cosa manca</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In anni di esperienza con WordPress mi sono resa conto di come la sua comunità cerchi di soddisfare i requisiti di accessibilità del web, sia nel frontend sia nel backend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ma purtroppo non è lo stesso per i temi e i plugin. Chi sviluppa prodotti di terze parti, commerciali e gratuiti, il più delle volte non possiede molte competenze in materia di accessibilità, per cui l&#8217;installazione di un componente è spesso un rischio; quando si ha a che fare con una disabilità è frequente avere più plugin, laddove un utente senza disabilità può affidarsi solo a uno.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Il risultato è un backend misto e disordinato, fatto di componenti accessibili e inaccessibili tanto da richiedere anche l&#8217;aiuto di esperti a pagamento per modificare ciò che non si è in grado di eseguire in autonomia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Questa situazione provoca sicuramente frustrazione e abbiamo due scelte per affrontarla: una è quella di lamentarci con la nostra ristretta cerchia di amici, risolvendo il problema da soli o rinunciando, l&#8217;altra è quella di aprire un dialogo con gli sviluppatori di plugin o temi per sensibilizzarli all&#8217;accessibilità, facendo del nostro meglio per evitare che altri vivano quello che abbiamo vissuto noi.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inutile dire che la seconda opzione è la migliore, perché la comunità è importante e solo la diffusione di conoscenze e competenze può creare un mondo migliore a lungo termine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-le-persone-che-credono-in-me\">Le persone che credono in me</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Quando si prende confidenza con un prodotto, si ha piacere di dare una mano agli altri nel suo utilizzo perché la condivisione è aiuto reciproco.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La prima esperienza è stata col mio amico Roberto, anche lui privo della vista, guidandolo nella creazione del suo sito e podcast basato su WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mottopodcast.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Motto </a><a href=\"https://www.mottopodcast.org\">Podcast</a> racconta &#8220;storie inclusive&#8221; di persone con disabilità visiva da tutto il mondo impegnate nella vita quotidiana, nel lavoro e nello sport, oltre a varie informazioni sulla cultura giapponese e Roberto ha scelto il termine &#8220;motto&#8221; perché fonde due significati:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>motto, in italiano: slogan di incoraggiamento, incitamento</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Motto, in giapponese: vuol dire &#8220;più&#8221;.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Il nome del podcast diventa &#8220;incoraggiamento a fare di più&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Esattamente quello che hanno fatto i primi successi di Roberto: mi hanno incoraggiato a fare di più, così mi sono iscritta a una comunità italiana chiamata <a href=\"https://www.sos-wp.it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SOS </a><a href=\"https://www.sos-wp.it\">WP </a>per confrontarmi e aiutare altri su WordPress e Gutenberg; è qui che ho conosciuto lei, Gloria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web designer, WordPress trainer, <a href=\"https://www.gloweb.it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gloria </a><a href=\"https://www.gloweb.it\">Liuni</a> si è incuriosita e interessata su come io potessi usare computer e smartphone senza la vista.

I am thrilled to have here today Jesse Friedman, Joshua Goode (as in food, not goody as I&#8217;d like to say it), and Kevin Walker from Bluehost. I&#8217;m Robert Jacobi, and we&#8217;ll be talking about the recent partnership between Bluehost and WP Cloud. Jesse, let&#8217;s do some quick introductions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />I&#8217;m Jesse Friedman. I&#8217;m running WP Cloud. I am a Rhode Island native, well, I shouldn&#8217;t say native. I grew up in New York, but I live in Rhode Island now. I&#8217;ve been working at Automattic for nearly 10 years, mostly on Jetpack and now with WP Cloud, and really just focused on helping to provide better services to hosting companies so they can succeed in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Excellent. Kevin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />Hey, good morning. Kevin Walker here. I look after marketing at Bluehost, based here in Austin, Texas, and I really spend most of my time figuring out how to make sure our current and future customers are fully aware of what&#8217;s going on from a product perspective. I&#8217;m looking forward to our chat today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Yeah, and it&#8217;s great that you&#8217;re in Austin. I should mention that we&#8217;re here at Cloudfest US and NamesCon, and so it&#8217;s a very exciting and dynamic crowd, especially with the NamesCon folks on the domain side. Josh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />Yeah, Joshua Goode. I am the partner success manager/technical account manager. We&#8217;re still figuring it out. I do a lot of the technical side of things, but I&#8217;m also just there to help people onboard, integrate, and handle any rare issues they might encounter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Excellent. So this has been in the making for a long time and was announced back in March during WordCamp Asia and sort of semi-concurrently with Cloudfest in Germany. Let&#8217;s start with how this discussion began about Bluehost working on a platform that isn&#8217;t theirs, if I can put it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s a fair assessment. Outside of Automattic, Bluehost is the largest contributor to the WordPress project, and we&#8217;re proud of that. Our WordPress-centric brand, if you read Review Signal and other benchmarking studies, is also very, very good at delivering well-performing, shared hosting. The reality, though, is shared hosting doesn&#8217;t meet the needs of some very demanding users, particularly agencies and people who have high-traffic websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a part of the market that we knew we needed to develop into. We certainly looked at building things internally but came to the ultimate decision, why build when we can borrow, partner, or buy? I don&#8217;t know what the right words are with WP Cloud. It&#8217;s a fantastic infrastructure that ultimately perfectly meets the needs of the demanding customers and new customers we&#8217;re going after. With an existing partnership already in place on so many fronts, it was just a natural progression to continue into the infrastructure as a service agreement that we did with WP Cloud and Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />So before I get to your side of the equation, Jesse, as I talk with my hands, which no one can see on an audio podcast, what does that look like to some degree that you don&#8217;t actually have to worry about your infrastructure?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />Oh, it&#8217;s fantastic, right? Certainly we did our due diligence and made sure that the commitment around 100% uptime, speed, and all the other things that we care about are there, and they certainly are. What we get to do is focus on what we do, which is the service and support, which is not part of WP Cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you put Bluehost and Automattic together, you really do have a great marriage in that you&#8217;ve got the infrastructure people worrying about the infrastructure, scale, and all the things that we&#8217;re worried about there. We&#8217;ve developed a dedicated support team that&#8217;s specific to this product and these customers. So if you&#8217;re using Bluehost Cloud today, when you pick up the phone and need support, you&#8217;re not going through the typical triage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think about the equivalent when my internet goes out; the first thing they ask me is to restart my router, and I&#8217;ve already done that three times. You skip right to the experts who are knowledgeable not only about the product but also about WordPress in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll just end by saying a lot of hosts, well, their support team candidly, quickly tries to make sure it&#8217;s not their fault and then passes the customer off to a plugin vendor or somebody else. We&#8217;re trying to instill in our support team at Bluehost Cloud the mindset of getting to a resolution regardless of whose fault it is. We&#8217;ve hired experts in the WordPress space that can help our customers dig into things that are beyond the hosting layer and into plugin compatibility and other issues that WordPress users often find challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />And so, which of course leads to the question I always want to know, how did WP Cloud even get going? Obviously, Automattic does a ton of hosting. There&#8217;s WordPress VIP, which is another flavor of hosting, WordPress.com, and so on. Is this sort of almost like something that&#8217;s been in the works for five years, similar to Amazon saying, &#8220;Oh, we have a bunch of servers, and now we&#8217;re going to make AWS?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />Yeah, you nailed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />This will be our shortest podcast ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />The WP Cloud team began as an internal company product called Atomic. It was our effort to redefine the way in which we provide cloud hosting for WordPress. We knew we have so much knowledge and experience from our teams hosting hundreds of millions of sites on WordPress.com and the highest traffic sites in the world on VIP. We took the brilliant people behind that to build out the next platform that we wanted to use for ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because WordPress.com or Automattic is wholly focused on hosting WordPress, we have some side ventures, Tumblr, PocketCasts, and things like that. But when it comes to websites, we only focus on providing WordPress. That opportunity for focus and those guardrails we put up allow us to do something that other people just can&#8217;t. When you look at other cloud platforms, they have a universal solution for everything, from warehouse logistics to virtual reality gaming. WordPress site hosting is a small fraction of their focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we knew that we needed to build something that would revolutionize the way in which we&#8217;re serving WordPress. We wanted to do that internally. And so yeah, five plus years, we released it internally as our cloud platform. Then a few years ago, we started to look at ways in which we could bring it to the rest of the ecosystem. We knew what we had. It was working unbelievably well, billions of pages a month already. These sites are incredibly fast, highly reliable. We&#8217;re offering 100% uptime with our partners. The reason we&#8217;re able to do that is because the platform is tried and tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The newest part about it is really the brand. WP Cloud has really only been out in the wild since just before Cloudfest 2023. That was our effort of saying, &#8220;Hey, how do we bring this great thing that we built that we know works really well to the rest of the world?&#8221; We wanted to identify hosting parties that we knew would be excellent candidates in the WordPress space. Bluehost has been a great WordPress or internet citizen as a company for many years. They do a great deal of contributions to WordPress, sponsoring events around the world, and we knew that partnering with them as a flagship partner would be an opportunity for us to make sure that we&#8217;re aligning ourselves with someone who has the same focus on success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Nice. So we&#8217;re going to want to know the tricks of the trade. I&#8217;m glad Josh is here to tell us what makes that infrastructure a bit more compelling than saying, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re just going to roll up a managed WordPress service on AWS or Google Cloud.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />Jesse kind of hit a good point on that. WordPress.com, millions of WordPress sites, WordPress VIP, some of the highest traffic sites. We took all of our knowledge and experience from those things and built this platform to where it&#8217;s just for WordPress and had everything that we needed for performance, security, and those core needs baked into the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as Bluehost Cloud launched, it automatically had a firewall, DDoS protections, SSL certificates for every site, global caching right out of the box. There are no plugins to install, nothing to configure. You have a Global Edge cache. It&#8217;s going back to our Automattic core backbone network that we have all around the world with our edge centers and servers, putting WP Cloud on that and beefing it up. We&#8217;re essentially offering this thing to where someone can just go create a site and, whether you&#8217;re in Australia or the US, you have amazing speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every decision on database caching, our decisions on how our global edge cache works, our decisions on just normal page cache. I&#8217;m talking a lot about cache because that&#8217;s kind of our bread and butter, and our global network is a big chunk of that. The full stack of how simple it should be for a user to create a site and it just works and performs the way they expect and want it to as a user. And then from a host perspective, how easy it is to create those sites and how easy it is to support those sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;m curious about the API, the platform, but is there any kind of… Is this running on Kubernetes? Is this running here or not? Can we get a little more of the secret sauce? I think folks might just be interested in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />No, with Kubernetes and different parts of Automattic, no. WP Cloud essentially avoids that type of containerization. We actually keep it as complex as it can be, and again, I&#8217;m towing the line here, but…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />But that&#8217;s why we are on Do the Woo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />Right. We have a lot of experience with Nginx, and we have a very advanced network</p>\n\n\n\n<p>of load balancers, server pools, and individual servers. It&#8217;s just a very advanced network on there. If you want to know something, DVN, Engine X, however it&#8217;s said, that&#8217;s kind of there. But no, we actually avoid containers. I will say we have a unique SSH proxy where there may be some containerization there just for security purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />The key thing to take away from all this is that we built it up from the ground up and we&#8217;re not outsourcing. We make sure that we&#8217;re highlighting the fact that we&#8217;re partnering with open-source software, PHP, MariaDB, things like that. But for the most part, everything is homegrown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />That&#8217;s brilliant. So then of course, reading into the APIs and connectivity, from the Bluehost perspective, what does it look like to actually all of a sudden integrate on top of this huge platform?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />I mean, so you&#8217;re talking to a dumb marketer and not a technical engineer, but I&#8217;d take the position that it doesn&#8217;t really matter from a customer perspective. What matters is that it works, it&#8217;s fast, and if I do have an issue, I can get ahold of the right person quickly to help me resolve it. We put a financial commitment behind the 100% uptime. So WP Cloud and Automattic say, we&#8217;re going to guarantee you 100% uptime. We then put a financial commitment to our customers on top of that promise. So if there is, for some reason, downtime, they&#8217;re going to get their money back, depending on how long the outage is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From an API perspective, we have our own console on top of the infrastructure. That&#8217;s what I was curious about. It&#8217;s an account manager where you can go in and provision sites and manage plugins. You can go into WP admin directly and do most of that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We took the initial path forward that less is more. Let WP admin do a lot of the heavy lifting that people are used to working with and really just keep to the basics around provisioning, scaling up to larger accounts if you need more space or websites, and leave the rest to the native functionality of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />I think one thing that&#8217;s really interesting is that because WP Cloud or Automattic is handling the infrastructure, managing the platform, making sure that sites are up and running efficiently and fast, that gives Bluehost Cloud the opportunity to reinvest back into the tools they provide for agencies. We&#8217;re taking on everything below that API layer and managing that for Bluehost Cloud but also for the end user as well. We do a remarkable amount of management and work around keeping WordPress instances up to date, making sure there aren&#8217;t plugin conflicts anytime there&#8217;s an issue. When we do run an update, we have regression testing to make sure that there aren&#8217;t problems with that. We take care of all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That allows Bluehost Cloud to really focus on the tools they want to provide to agencies, which I think is where the next phase of this innovation is going to be. We&#8217;re going to focus on providing the fastest, most secure, and reliable platform. Bluehost Cloud is going to be focused on providing tools that help agencies run their business, save them money, make them more money per hour, be more efficient, and grow. The list goes on from there. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m super excited about this opportunity because it&#8217;s leveraging something we built to build something even better for the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />To get there, this is a fairly new segment. Agencies have been using Bluehost since we created the business, but it was in more of the &#8220;I just need some simple shared hosting for my simple client to use&#8221; mode. We&#8217;re moving essentially upmarket to the more complex, advanced needs of larger agencies. We&#8217;re not going to pretend that we know everything about agencies. So we&#8217;re taking an approach to, again, start with less is more. We&#8217;re having an advisory council that&#8217;s been built out that&#8217;s going to input into the needs of agencies so we can actually create something that&#8217;s valuable, meaningful, and helpful rather than assume that we know everything. By the time this is posted, we&#8217;ll have announced that we are launching a program that gives additional benefits to our agency partners in the form of financial benefits, commissions, discounts, and access to certain levels of support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />That&#8217;s amazing. I have a couple of questions swirling around in my head. You just mentioned support, so let me tackle that. Is there a point where a Bluehost customer would actually speak with support at WP Cloud?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />No? So that would never happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />No. We certainly, as a customer of WP Cloud, have access, and we have regular standups and we&#8217;re very closely working together. Our engineers and their engineers are on a first-name basis and are close working partners. But the support that you&#8217;re going to require, you would contact Bluehost Cloud support. So far, we have 100% resolution on the first call. We&#8217;re not seeing any challenges with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I&#8217;m going to make a huge assumption, and Joshua or Jesse can set me straight. Is there sort of a semi-walled garden around what kind of WordPress hosting you can do? I&#8217;m just going to make a crazy example. Say I wanted to launch my WordPress 3.1 site on WP Cloud. Would that even be possible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />You might get away with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />No. We really focus on keeping up to date and staying in line with the WordPress launch schedule. For performance, security, and just the general progression of WordPress, if we all keep up and continue moving together, it just helps the ecosystem so much more. We do offer some transition windows, but no, if you spin up a site right now, it will be the latest release version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />So back to the sort of agency side of the universe, I&#8217;m an agency with a number of core legacy WordPress sites. Those would probably all have to be updated. At a minimum, if not, depending on how legacy or what plugin issues there might be. So tying to that plugin thing, do you actually have sort of an allow list of plugins, or can I just create my Bitcoin miner plugin and drop it off?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />We have a very small list of blacklisted plugins, plugins that we know are doing something either malicious or so outside the box, strange and poorly done that it&#8217;s causing performance issues. For the most part, you can put any plugins you want onto it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />We work quite a bit with plugin developers to actually help them spend a good chunk of time if we do notice issues. Given our scale, we can see trends in certain plugins. So I do spend a bit of time reaching out and working with plugin developers, not just to be compatible with our platform or more compatible, but to be better on any host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />Yes, and I think it&#8217;s important to recognize that I do understand that there are agencies out there who are running sites for clients that may have older versions of software because the client doesn&#8217;t have the budget to upgrade it or it&#8217;s a really complex build. When you get to a place where you are allowing these older versions of the software to exist, then again, you get back into a lack of focus. Because we have a very strong focus on providing the sites for the most up-to-date version of WordPress, I think we allow a version or two, we have a transition. So it&#8217;s not like the day that the new WordPress version comes out, you have to be ready to move. The point is that when we narrow our focus to provide support for one or two of the latest versions of WordPress, we are able to provide even better performance and security. The minute you start doing dozens of versions, it just increases the amount of work ahead of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />We want to help improve the standards of the WordPress ecosystem. I work with plugin developers and theme developers, but overall we want to push the whole community forward. The more sites we can keep on the most recent version, the better it is for everyone. We all want to push forward together and make it the best experience for the end user, to the point where the end user really shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about their WordPress being updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Oh yeah, the best kind of hosting is the kind you never think about. I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />This is a trend across the industry. I think all hosts, at least reputable ones, are realizing that the financial benefits of supporting a long, long, long list of versions aren&#8217;t worth the expense. You&#8217;ve got to narrow that focus. You&#8217;re paying for it as a customer. I worked at Dell during the whole Microsoft Windows XP situation, and this is reminiscent of that. If you have to support multiple versions, that gets extremely challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />Think of that when you call in for support. If you&#8217;re training your team to make sure that they&#8217;re providing the best support for the most recent version of WordPress, they don&#8217;t have to worry about the complexities that went into 3.1. That allows them to provide more efficient, better, and faster support, making sure you&#8217;re successful. But I&#8217;ll also tell you, we&#8217;re sitting right across from the expo area at Cloudfest, and I guarantee you that if you threw a hat in the air and it landed on any one of those tables, that host would have a story about having thousands of out-of-date WordPress sites. The process of upgrading those and keeping them secure, and what that means for the rest of their infrastructure, it&#8217;s a terrible process to have to go through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />It&#8217;s a customer support headache. It&#8217;s a resource like physical resource, meaning hardware, whether it&#8217;s on some other cloud provider or on your own infrastructure, that you&#8217;re probably wasting energy cycles and whatnot from bad code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />To go back to your original question, for the most part, we&#8217;re able to host anything here. In fact, we just released domain-based multi-site as well. Previously, we had subdirectory multi-site only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />So we&#8217;re continuing to innovate</p>\n\n\n\n<p>in that area and what we can provide support for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I&#8217;m curious about agencies who may have legacy content. Is part of the Bluehost agency partner program there to also help onboard existing or new agencies with these sites?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />It certainly helps onboarding new agencies. The question of agencies with outdated WordPress sites is one I actually haven&#8217;t considered. If there was a meaningful need and we heard from our customers that it was something of value, we&#8217;d absolutely figure out how to address it. We&#8217;ve partnered with a third party and now have a white-labeled version of a very successful migration tool. We can help customers migrate from our own shared infrastructure into the cloud infrastructure or from a different host onto Bluehost with the push of a button with well into the 90% success rate. We&#8217;re really excited about that because the switching costs are getting lower and lower. It&#8217;s getting easier and easier. Hopefully, we have an opportunity to be the beneficiary of that ease of movement. We hope to benefit as we bring better and better products to market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I see that as a huge direction for hosting overall. The baseline expectations are commoditized. Everyone can get their WordPress site up for at least a little bit. What&#8217;s the value add? Obviously, we&#8217;re seeing here today the Bluehost service level and user experience value add. You can&#8217;t beat a WP Cloud infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />You put your site on Bluehost Cloud, stress test it, objectively observe, measure, and benchmark it. You won&#8217;t find a better hosting experience or performance at the price point we have it at. Then you layer in a 100% uptime guarantee, financial guarantee, and the premium support that comes with it. I&#8217;m well aware that Bluehost does not have the best reputation in the agency space. I think that&#8217;s a function of people historically trying to put a round peg through a square hole and using shared hosting, which is not meant for a lot of client-facing needs. That&#8217;s where that reputation comes from. Give us a second chance. I think you&#8217;ll be really, really, really impressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />As a customer of Bluehost for almost 20 years now, I signed up for my first Bluehost account in 2005 when you were three years old. I&#8217;ve seen Bluehost provide shared hosting to millions of customers and do a really great job of it. I think they became synonymous with providing that service to these customers. Shared hosting is a fantastic solution, especially for WordPress. If you&#8217;re running your own site, running a blog, or even an eCommerce shop, shared hosting can be very successful, and Bluehost does it really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think that has created a slight barrier of entry for an agency considering this product. They may be thinking, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Bluehost. They&#8217;re really focused on shared hosting. It&#8217;s not going to be what I need. I have this incredibly high traffic site, or my eCommerce shop is getting thousands of transactions a day.&#8221; But if you&#8217;re on the fence, if you have a high traffic site like that, reach out to me or Kevin. We&#8217;ll figure out a way to get you on there so you can test it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The migration tools that they have make it a lot easier. If you are on the fence, let us talk to you about it. Let us give you some assurances. We&#8217;ll make sure your customers are happy, your clients are happy. At the end of the day, when you try it out for yourself and put some traffic behind it, it&#8217;s just going to speak for itself. The biggest problem you&#8217;re going to have is how to get the rest of your clients on it as fast as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Since this is a WooCommerce-focused podcast, and Kevin has mentioned multiple times this 100% uptime guarantee, is that just per minute it&#8217;s out? If I&#8217;m running a WooCommerce shop and based on, let&#8217;s say, monthly average sales, I&#8217;m out for a day, which we know won&#8217;t happen, are you saying that a day of sales would be insured?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />Not at this time. At this time, it&#8217;s to the cost of the infrastructure and your service cost on Bluehost Cloud. But we are talking in seconds and minutes, not in hours or days at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />But put aside the financial guarantee for a second. Let&#8217;s talk a little bit about how we&#8217;re providing the 100% uptime guarantee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Yes, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />First off, we scale vertically, not horizontally. We have the ability to add resources to a site in real-time without having to wait for services and additional resources. That is on top of the fact that we know exactly what we&#8217;re doing in terms of supporting hosting for e-commerce. I mean, we do own WooCommerce. If anybody&#8217;s going to know how to do it, it&#8217;s going to be us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, we have baked into every single WP Cloud site, and that means every Bluehost Cloud site has this, we have something called automated real-time failover. It live syncs your site from one data center to another. For example, if you are requesting an e-commerce website, you are a visitor to a website in middle America, and it&#8217;s pulling from our Texas Data Center. If something catastrophic were to happen, like the pipe gets cut or an asteroid lands on Texas, something terrible happens, that whole site is live synced to another data center, including e-commerce orders. If you place an order on the site and then instantaneously something happens, we will have live synced it there. We can reroute the traffic to that secondary data center so the visitors to the site won&#8217;t even feel the transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have four origin centers and 28 data centers around the globe. We&#8217;re doing a ridiculous amount of redundancies in terms of backups, which automatically come with this product. We are taking special care to make sure we are putting processes in place that no one else can really replicate to offer this level of service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I&#8217;m the database geek, and I&#8217;m going to put Josh on the spot here. How do you do that with the databases?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />Every site is doing constant real-time replication to another region. Getting into some of the technical specifics…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />But you&#8217;re not copying the files. You&#8217;re doing split queries across multiple…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s one way to put it. I will say maybe it&#8217;s not always the easiest. We&#8217;ve had to look in and make sure our binary logs or our bin logs aren&#8217;t just exploding in size, but we&#8217;ve got it kind of perfected to where every site on WP Cloud has real-time database replication to another. The file system&#8217;s already there. If one server or the data center goes down, that site instantly flips to another region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for how we&#8217;re doing that, I&#8217;ll just say it&#8217;s real-time database replication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I&#8217;m going to say it can&#8217;t be just what we think of as traditional replication. So I have to imagine that there&#8217;s some kind of SQL abstraction layer that&#8217;s potentially data…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />There is a level of abstraction there. I would say every single query is logged there in our binary logs, and that&#8217;s kind of how it&#8217;s handled and pushed out to its secondary database server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />For end users on Bluehost Cloud, it just looks like a MySQL database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />If you have an agency that wants to explain it to their client, you can just let them know that we do live sync, which means real-time replication of the data from one data center to another. That gives them the assurance to sell this to their high-end e-commerce clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />So I assume that those talking points from WP Cloud get passed over to Bluehost Cloud, which then, as part of your partner program, gives them that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />I&#8217;ll tell you something right now, for everybody at home who wants to sign up for Bluehost Cloud and then sell it to their clients, there is no a la carte or piecemeal parts of WP Cloud that Bluehost Cloud doesn&#8217;t have. So anything that you ever hear anybody talking about WP Cloud, whether it&#8217;s at a conference like this, another podcast, or whatever, if WP Cloud has it, then Bluehost Cloud has it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Okay, that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />The only thing that I think is unique to Bluehost versus some other small hosts that we see around the world, who have also started to leverage WP Cloud, is the packaging and the pricing and how we&#8217;re thinking about our packaging. It could vary from host to host, but again, the infrastructure is going to be the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve taken a different approach. Instead of a per-site model where we allocate resources per site in a predetermined fashion, you buy a number of sites and with a number of PHP workers, you can assign those workers to sites at your discretion. Maybe the small little site you put two PHP workers on, and this other site that your client has that has really high demand, you might put eight. Where others have taken more of a &#8220;every site gets two PHP workers&#8221; approach, we&#8217;ve added a lot more flexibility in our approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />This is the beauty of us being able to provide what we&#8217;re doing. We&#8217;re purely focusing on the platform. Our engineers are not getting into the business of WP Cloud. They&#8217;re focused on providing the absolute fastest, most secure platform. What that allows us to do is to partner with hosts and cultivate or even grow the diversity in hosting that we need for WordPress to be successful. This is speaking to something a little bit more philosophical, but the reality of the situation is there are more than enough WordPress websites to go around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we&#8217;re aiming to do with WP Cloud is raise the bar for the way in which hosting is done. We want WP Cloud to become synonymous with the best cloud platform for WordPress anywhere. The beauty of partnering with Bluehost or anyone else we might partner with is that they have the ability to bolt on additional services, partner with companies that they want to partner with. For example, Yoast, right? With Bluehost Cloud, you get Yoast bundled with it. There are opportunities for them to go beyond that and do deeper integrations into Yoast, things like that. They can bundle their pricing differently. This</p>\n\n\n\n<p>gives them the opportunity to really carve out an opportunity to provide better service to agencies, whereas somebody else might be focused on something else specifically. That allows for innovation and solving specific problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />I like that. We talked about the partnerships. What does it cost? I know I&#8217;m not going to get the real secrets here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />What Bluehost Cloud costs or…?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />What does it cost for Bluehost to work on top of or partner with WP Cloud? What does that look like for Bluehost?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />I would love for Kevin to talk. I&#8217;ll touch on this briefly. I would love Kevin to talk about the pricing for Bluehost Cloud because I think people will be interested in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model we have for WP Cloud is making it accessible. We&#8217;re trying to keep our prices generally very affordable and significantly cheaper than trying to replicate this with AWS or Google Cloud. Right now, our pricing is focused on a per-site, per-month cost based on a snapshot of the resources allocated to that site, like the number of PHP workers, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would love to go more in-depth into how WP Cloud operates from a partnership perspective, but for today and the audience in the room, I think what&#8217;s more relevant is, what does this actually cost the agency?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />It&#8217;s a huge deal, literally, and it&#8217;s just interesting to see how some of the sausage is made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />Before we transition, Jesse likes to highlight that there&#8217;s no upfront cost. You pay for what you use. Your costs should be diverted to building out your side of the equation, marketing, selling, and supporting them. There&#8217;s nothing to sign up and work with us just to get started and to test things out. That&#8217;s not a cost. Then it comes from your usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />To be super clear, he&#8217;s talking about WP Cloud, not Bluehost. If you&#8217;re a host and listening to this podcast, that was for you. For everyone else, because of what you just said, Josh, you&#8217;ll see packages that scale. The price will scale with usage, with some sort of resources allocated to that package. That&#8217;s because hosts are being charged based on the amount of resources they&#8217;re consuming. Their packaging is probably going to be linear toward price and resources will be somewhat correlated to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Bluehost Cloud, our early access pricing, which is still live today, a single site plan is $29 a month, and a 50-site plan is $190. Those are the two guardrails. There are 10 and 25 site plans in between. You go compare that to the market, and I promise you, we are extremely cost-efficient at those price points. We&#8217;re one of the largest hosts in the world, one of the largest WordPress hosts in the world. Because of that scale, we have the opportunity to give some of that value back to our customers through really advantageous pricing. You&#8217;re getting the same infrastructure that another host may be selling at twice the price, but it&#8217;s the same infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />The only place you can get the bat phone. I love calling it that because it&#8217;s the blue phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />Or you&#8217;re getting a host that isn&#8217;t using WP Cloud, and we can talk about the disadvantage of that. AWS is amazing as a general cloud infrastructure for all these varying needs, but if you were building a WordPress site, why would you not want an infrastructure specifically built for WordPress and WordPress performance? You should test it out and really put us through the ringer. Put a site on our plan and see how it goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />I was just saying one thing. Sorry, we didn&#8217;t go into too much detail about the database. I didn&#8217;t want to take too much time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />It&#8217;s also important to keep some things close to the vest, not necessarily for IP, but also for security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />That&#8217;s right. And for the sake of time. But taking a step back, PHPMyAdmin access is available, but overall, there&#8217;s no… As Bluehost Cloud uses this, they use the WP Cloud Atomic API. They spin all the sites up via API, configure them, and make all their adjustments over an API. There&#8217;s no setting up a server, no &#8220;What&#8217;s the database credentials and what&#8217;s up with that?&#8221; It&#8217;s all done with one API call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />Our very first customer. We announced at 10:00 AM Eastern that day. At 10:06 AM, we had our first customer. They bought a Cloud 10 package. They migrated their site. They&#8217;re based in British Columbia, Canada, in about nine minutes, I think, is what it took them to get the site live on the infrastructure. They must have realized things were going well because they had nine more sites. Second plan. I mean, it is really, really easy and simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />We are seeing sites that are incredibly fast. When we pull up a new WP Cloud site, it&#8217;s an average of six, seven seconds before you&#8217;re in the WP admin. It&#8217;s nearly instantaneous. There are a lot of sort of warm sites ready to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />No, this is all kind of on-demand. The infrastructure is all there, warm and ready to go. But the sites, no. I mean, that&#8217;s all new and it&#8217;s all provisioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />You&#8217;re absolutely right. The thing that&#8217;s really intriguing about that is that we have the ability to provide pools for agencies to really build these things into their workflows. For example, if you&#8217;re using the SSH to spool up sites, things like that, manage and configure them. We also have templating tools, things like that. You can create, man, I forget the term, but somebody gave me the perfect one for template sites. If you&#8217;re an agency and you run a hundred e-commerce shops, you&#8217;re probably starting with the same plugins and the same configuration every single time. Those are things you can just clone, and it&#8217;s the same amount of time. Think about how much faster that makes your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Oh, yeah. Stuff you don&#8217;t have to worry about. You can actually focus on your customers with an agency, what your value add will be as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />If Bluehost support is helping an agency that maybe is coming off an old WordPress version and they&#8217;re needing quick access to the PHP logs, that&#8217;s an API call. You have SSH access if you want to go in and do some other things. But if Bluehost Cloud wants to provide that directly to users or their support team needs it, there&#8217;s an API call for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />No, that&#8217;s fantastic. Let&#8217;s wrap this up so people can actually use it for building out their site. I found the cloud. Any final thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joshua:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;m really passionate about this project. I wish we had more time to go into even more technical detail. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working on across Automattic for years now, and I&#8217;m so excited to have partners like Bluehost and just getting more people looking at the platform. Jesse may have some other stuff they might want to bring up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse:<br />It&#8217;s too bad he won&#8217;t hear this if you&#8217;re actually at Cloudfest because it&#8217;ll take a little time to publish this. But in a couple of hours, I&#8217;m giving a talk and unveiling a new soon-to-be open-source platform UI. The idea there is to really encourage people to rip it apart, extend it, expand on it, or help us to understand it&#8217;s in the same light and narrative of what Bluehost Cloud is trying to do, which is that we are trying to provide tools and resources so that we can allow our clients, our agencies, to tell us what it is that they need next, what it is that they want. That&#8217;s in total alignment with what Bluehost Cloud is doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To that point, I&#8217;m on Twitter as @Professor. Although if you go to the WP Cloud website, you&#8217;ll see ways to get in touch with me. If you have any questions about this, if you want to talk more, if you want to tell me about your current situation and what you&#8217;re faced with and you just want to chat about whether or not Bluehost Cloud or WP Cloud is right for you, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />That&#8217;s awesome. Jesse and Kevin, you have the last word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kevin:<br />I think you&#8217;ll have the last word if I know you well enough. But okay. I think this is an exciting time, and we&#8217;re really seeing some really cool stuff happening with the customers that have come over and started using the product. I encourage anyone listening today, if you need a high-performance site, give us a shot. What&#8217;s to lose? $29 and some time? I think there&#8217;s a lot to gain when you see the performance. The price-to-value ratio is excellent. If you&#8217;re an agency, Kevin.Walker@NewFold.com, or go to our website and fill out a form for the agency program, and we&#8217;ll get you signed up with a free account to test it yourself. If you don&#8217;t need high performance, just a reminder, our shared hosting is Review Signal top best in class. We&#8217;re proud of that too. Thanks for having me on, Robert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />That&#8217;s why Kevin&#8217;s in marketing. We make sure to cover everything. Fantastic. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have more podcasts, especially around the technology. Do the Woo has a tech podcast as well, so that would be really interesting to have you guys on board for that. Thank you all for listening to another Do the Woo.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>The WordPress Way</em></strong>, host <strong>Robert Jacobi</strong> talks with <strong>Jesse Friedman </strong>and<strong> Joshua Goode from WP Cloud, </strong>and<strong> Kevin Walker </strong>from<strong> Bluehost</strong> about their new partnership. Jesse explains WP Cloud&#8217;s development within Automattic, emphasizing its optimized infrastructure for WordPress hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This partnership aims to enhance Bluehost&#8217;s offerings for high-demand users, particularly agencies and high-traffic websites, by leveraging WP Cloud&#8217;s specialized infrastructure and support features like automated real-time failover and vertical scaling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse Friedman introduces himself, running WP Cloud and working at Automattic for nearly 10 years. Kevin Walker oversees marketing at Bluehost, based in Austin, Texas. Joshua Goode is the partner success manager/technical account manager at WP Cloud and Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The partnership between Bluehost and WP Cloud was announced in March during WordCamp Asia and Cloudfest in Germany.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bluehost is the largest contributor to the WordPress project outside of Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shared hosting doesn’t meet the needs of some demanding users, particularly agencies and high-traffic websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bluehost decided to partner with WP Cloud instead of building their own solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Cloud is a specialized infrastructure focused solely on WordPress, leveraging Automattic&#8217;s experience with WordPress.com and WordPress VIP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Cloud offers features like automated real-time failover, vertical scaling, and specialized support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bluehost can focus on enhancing tools and services for agencies due to WP Cloud handling the infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Cloud avoids containerization like Kubernetes, using advanced networks of load balancers and server pools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integration with WP Cloud is done via APIs, making provisioning and managing sites easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Cloud sites have built-in features like firewall, DDoS protection, SSL certificates, and global caching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automated real-time failover ensures high availability and reliability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.cloud/\">WP Cloud</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, another WordCamp Europe is in the books. We had the second-highest number of tickets sold in the history of our event series, with the first being WordCamp Europe in Berlin. But even with that number of tickets sold, that number of people gathering together to talk about WordPress and related things, there were still a lot of people who didn&#8217;t get to join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For some, that came with experiencing FOMO, but some of you embraced the JOMO of it all. Either way, at this point, there are a good collection of wrap-ups and round-ups going around, so I&#8217;m here to tell you a bit about what was buzzing in the hallway track.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, everyone was so excited to see old friends and make new ones. Everywhere I turned, I saw WordPressers in clusters catching up, most included new to the crew faces. So we know that we were using the Pac-Man rule that we love so much. But even while they were catching up on the last two, three, four years, they were also talking to each other about how to get more folks to things like this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we all generally agree that your first time meeting other WordPressers can be a truly pivotal moment in your WordPress journey, it was a delight to hear so much brainstorming focused on that. From mentorship to community introduction and the future of our events, the question of how to keep our ecosystem healthy and thriving was a big topic. Does any one of us have all the answers to this? No, but fortunately, we&#8217;ve got a global set of thinkers working on this global question. So, together, I&#8217;m sure we can come up with some good guesses to try out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Secondly, I saw a ton of talks and discussions about career development, not only about how to learn more but also how to be a champion for open source in your company, how to advocate for contribution as a best business practice. And what other communities can teach us about how they commit to their user&#8217;s continuing education, for lack of a friendlier term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And boy, do I love a good conversation about how to make working in open source easier, make it more meaningful, and more impactful. I&#8217;m in favor of anything that helps to dignify our profession. The front-facing, easy-to-use experience of WordPress, in particular, has been misunderstood to mean that we are a simple piece of software for simple tasks. And that is the way with our mission really. If we succeed at democratizing publishing or learning or commerce for that matter, we are taking the arcane and making it mundane. But simple to use doesn&#8217;t mean simple to create. And I want all of our future employers and clients to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing that I saw lighting up the hallway track was the idea of bringing life and excitement back to the web. WordPress has been fighting against closed systems for a long time, but as Matt alluded to in his keynote, merely having an open web is still not quite as fun as having an active and dynamic one. And we saw that both in general desire to bring fun back to being online, but also in the fresh variety of demos and workshops that we saw in the fun that was brought to the event. There were new and shocking implementations of Playground, I must say. Which, as far as I can tell, will basically be able to run everything one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But at WordCamp Europe, it ran; it powered our second massive hybrid translation event, where we translated something like 50,000 strings. We also had an amazing speed-building duel with an accepted future challenge between Jessica Lyschik and Matt Mullenweg. And not for nothing; the way we designed; the way the event area was put together included ways to stop and just have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a little grassy area with yard games and smaller pods of chairs for those quick hallway catch-ups that you just don&#8217;t get anywhere else. And for me, it was simply lovely to see everyone embracing the fun that was there, but also hearing about how much they wanted to help the web embrace the fun that could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:48] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Thanks for listening to my hallway track recap. Hopefully, it caused JOMO, not FOMO. And now, let&#8217;s turn our attention to the small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First thing on my list is WordPress 6.6 update. So we are reaching the release candidate phase tomorrow. WordPress 6.6 RC1 will be released, so download and join the community helping us to get this release out the door. It is scheduled for July 16th. If you have plugins or themes or any sort of business that uses WordPress, now is the time to get in and test it on a test site. I don&#8217;t recommend putting it in production at any point, but come and test it. Help us break it so that we can make sure that it doesn&#8217;t break for other people, for the, you know, 43% of the web that uses it when we get it out the door on the 16th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is that we have a WordPress Project Contributor Handbook V2 out there. It aims to be the quintessential resource for everyone in our community. And it will provide a bird&#8217;s eye view of where to find key information and different aspects of our community. How it all kind of connects together. And, just like a release, we really need some feedback from you. There is the repo on GitHub where you can go and kind of make inline comments, join the discussion about it. It can be a go-to resource if we look at it together and make sure that it has as much information as clearly stated as you wished you had when you were learning your way around WordPress for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on the list is actually another handbook. So, the Sustainability Team has put together a handbook specifically for events. It&#8217;s their first version, and over the past few months, members of that team have been sharing their ideas and experiences on how WordPress community events can be held more sustainably. All this input created a first draft, which eventually became this first version. And so we&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes, wander over there, take a look at it, see what some best practices for sustainable events are in the WordPress ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing on my list is about WordCamp US. I realize this is a podcast about WordCamp Europe right now. And so it&#8217;s odd to think that I&#8217;m moving right along into WordCamp US. However, there is a deadline coming up. July 1st is the last day to sign up to be a volunteer at this event. It&#8217;s taking place this year in Portland, Oregon, on the west side of the US. And it should be a really fun time. It&#8217;s middle of September. Come on out there. Learn about WordPress. Learn about contribution. Maybe get some voodoo donuts. You know, the important things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordCamp Europe, WordPress 6.6, Gutenberg 18.6. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at Gutenberg Times, and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source Project sponsored by Automattic&#8217;s Five for the Future program. As co-host, I&#8217;m thrilled to have again Jessica Lyschick with me. She is a Front end and WordPress Developer at GREYD, co-lead of development of Twenty Twenty Four theme, and was the co-lead organizer of WordCamp Germany last year. We both just returned from WordCamp Europe in Torino. Welcome to the show again, Jessica, how are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Well, I&#8217;m good. I finally got some much needed rest the past couple of days. Some extra sleep because you do not get that during Wordcamp Europe as always, or any WordCamp. Yeah, but I&#8217;m doing good. Glad that you have me on the show again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I had the same thing. It took me about a day and a half to really recover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Monday was hard. Monday was hard. It was like, &#8220;Ugh, I don&#8217;t want to get up at all.&#8221; But I had to go grocery shopping because the fridge was empty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So in that case Lieferando is also a good place to get food delivered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: Oh, I did have sushi in the evening, so I did not cook on Monday at all. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, not today.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordCamp Europe</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I hear you. I hear you. So one of my takeaways from WordCamp Europe is that Jessica is one of the most courageous people I know. Not only did you prepare a presentation on the Twenty Twenty Four theme pushing default themes forward, you also participated in a live onstage speed building challenge against Rich Tabor. And then during Q&amp;A, you challenged Matt Mullenweg to also participate in one. So let&#8217;s talk about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On this show, we talk quite a bit about the Twenty Twenty Four theme and appeared with you as also with Maggie Cabrera. So we covered how versatile it is and also about the kudos it received around the community, so contract relations. And in the post on the Gutenberg Times, seven talks about block themes and beyond at WordCamp Europe. The talk is listed, your talk is listed. Including a link for the recording. So if you don&#8217;t know dear listeners, much about Twenty Twenty Four or the nature of open nature of default themes, that&#8217;s a great talk to watch on the rerun. So let&#8217;s talk about the speed building challenge, Jessica.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> For those listeners who don&#8217;t know, Jamie Marsland, a longtime WordPress educator and YouTuber invented a format and invited WebPress community members to recreate sites on his YouTube channel. I&#8217;ll share a playlist of the five that were already done in the show notes, but you can see Rich Tabor, Justin Tadlock, Nick Diego, and others competing with fellows from the page builder community. I&#8217;m sure Jessica, you also noticed that they&#8217;re all dudes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: Except for one. There was, I think it was Kim Coleman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, right. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Was in the second one, but that&#8217;s what I complained to Jamie. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;There&#8217;s not so much diversity in your lineup there.&#8221; And then Jamie was like, &#8220;Oh, can you come to work in Europe and do it there?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Nice. So you went against Rich Tabor and how did that work out? What did you have to build and how did you go about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: So that was a really fun thing to do. So before we started, Jamie teased us with the Lingscars website. If you don&#8217;t know this one or maybe you have seen it before, lingscars.com, I think is the link. It&#8217;s a very crazy website. It&#8217;s like something from the early &#8217;00s with overstuffed images everywhere and patterns and crazy going on website. Which is like a cognitive nightmare, you could call it maybe. And I saw it already and I was like, &#8220;Oh no, please not this one. Anything but not this one.&#8221; But Jamie was just kidding. So he was trying to tease us there. And then he actually picked a website from the WordPress Rock Showcase, which is for the Noguchi Museum. And at first when you look at it looks like very simple, but it has some interesting details to it. So yeah, that was a great challenge and something definitely doable in 30 minutes as a rough sketch or more detailed sketch depending on how skilled you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. All right, so then how did you start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> So we got first a couple of minutes where we could look at the site ourselves to get the first idea in your head, what blocks do I use for this part or how do I make this part? And I&#8217;m usually someone who starts with the header, so I have to get the header done because otherwise it feels like the site is not really done. And then I moved on to the content and I didn&#8217;t pay so much attention to what Rich was doing because I was so much in my own tunnel and I need to get stuff done. I cannot look over what is he doing. But Jamie interrupted every now and then, so of course you cannot go like, &#8220;Ah, shut up.&#8221; But yeah, that was a really, really fun thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I can imagine that it was a little bit of a disconcerting because we are all people who are in our bubbles when we work hard, concentrated, and then interruptions are actually setting us back. But Jamie had a different job. He needed to entertain the audience there, yeah. So yeah, it was really interesting to see. But you did very well. So the header that you&#8217;re talking about, there was a sticky header, right? No, there was a sticky column.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>There was a sticky column in there. And I must say we looked at, it was like, &#8220;Oh my God, how I&#8217;m going to do it?&#8221; And then Rich explained it before going into it. I was like, &#8220;Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I&#8217;m going to do that too.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And that&#8217;s what I really found that watching you and Rich, it taught me a lot how to approach building websites, building themes or websites in the site editor. And that happens with every speed building challenge session that I watched. It&#8217;s a special way of building in public and problem solving in public. The time constraint is added. It&#8217;s an added thrill of course, but to show what&#8217;s possible once one gets over the learning curve because starting out with block themes and site editor, there&#8217;s certainly a learning curve there, yeah. And the difficulty that you encounter needs to be separated vs is that part of my learning process or is it going to be that way when I know how to do it? Is it still difficult? And I think a few people think that the learning process is part of how it&#8217;s always going to be and it never will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re going to get faster and faster, and you both did a great job recreating the website in 30 minutes. But it&#8217;s how fast you can get with a prototype. That was really astonishing for me and the visual idea out of your head. But of course you were all following a site that was already built. So all the discussions with the client beforehand were already done. What&#8217;s the color? What&#8217;s the content, what&#8217;s the image going to look like? But with the site, you can go very fast with your first prototypes and have a conversation started with the client. So this is definitely a good thing to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> And I think it&#8217;s also a good exercise for anyone who wants to try this themselves, especially if you&#8217;re a developer. Because I had this discussion with Collina I think before WordCamp Europe that if you code and are just in the code every day, all day, like I am usually. Using the site editor is so different because it brings you to another level of how do I implement this? How do I recreate visually what I have in my head? So I need to know, okay, I can use this block or that block, this block has this setting or feature I can use there. And I think it&#8217;s also very useful if you go on the other side, on the user side if you will, so you understand, okay, what are people struggling with and how can you make the code or the user experience better so that the users at the end of the day will also have it easier to create something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s a very good point. And with WordPress having a set of UI components, I think it&#8217;s really important for a developer to see how they work from a user perspective because that&#8217;s the learned experience that users come to WordPress with. And as a developer you don&#8217;t have to make those decisions anymore on the UI. But sometimes you need to make them, but then you have to decide, okay, where do I part from the WordPress components and build my own components. But I think knowing how far you can push the WordPress components in a user interface is really interesting to see, yeah. So that was the speed building challenge on live stage. So what on earth drove you to challenge Matt during the Q&amp;A to participate in one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Well, sometimes you have these stupid ideas that are just randomly popping up in your head and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Not bad.&#8221; I do have to say though that I did text my colleagues, &#8220;What do you think if I asked Matt this question?&#8221; And immediately I got three replies, &#8220;Do it, do it.&#8221; It was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks it&#8217;s a good question.&#8221; So I went up to the mic and I intentionally asked the question, not that I am challenging him to do one, but I intentionally said it, &#8220;When are you going to do one without adding me to the part of it?&#8221; So yeah that, maybe you can say escalated quickly into a challenge against Matt positively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Positively. Yeah, it came to an actionable thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yes. And yeah, I&#8217;m going to do it. So I&#8217;m not backing out of this. I mean, I&#8217;ve done one already on a stage in front of a couple hundred people. The room was so full but I didn&#8217;t really notice it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You got into your flow, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: &#8230; got into my flow. And then you ignore the audience. I heard the questions. Sometimes people ask questions specifically, but that&#8217;s like my world ended at my screen during that 30 minutes. I&#8217;ve done it already so I can do it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> To catch up with our listeners. So what happened on stage was Matt said, &#8220;Are you going to be the one I&#8217;m going to do it against? Are you in?&#8221; And Jessica said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; And then there was a side note from Matt to Matías Ventura who was sitting in the front row said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to train me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> No, I don&#8217;t think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And, yeah. After the conversation, was there any back and forth from stage? Was there any conversation afterwards yet about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> No, nothing in particular. I did meet Matt at the after party for a quick, &#8220;Hi, what was that?&#8221; No, it was very funny. We took a few pictures, his sister took a few pictures of us and I will do a video on my YouTube channel about this fairly soon. Maybe it&#8217;s already out once this podcast is published. If not, you will find that on my YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent, yes. And we definitely share the link to the YouTube channel in the show notes. And well, this comes out Saturday or Sunday. We are recording this on June. What&#8217;s the date? 21st?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> 21st, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> 2024. So it&#8217;ll come out either 23rd or the 24th, so yes. You can also follow along on the summer update by Matt Mullenweg in the show notes with the video to the keynote presentation. But there&#8217;s also a link to the Q&amp;A part of the keynote presentation that&#8217;s always separated out where you can recreate or revisit the exchange between Jessica and Matt. So I haven&#8217;t finished reflecting of WordCamp. Have you any first takeaways that you&#8217;d like to share?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> No, I try to relax this week mostly, to be honest. I did think about a couple things. So first of all, it was an intense week for me as well. We were there with a great team. So that has been a really fun week, hanging out with everyone and WordCamp Europe was, again, so fast, passed by so fast and was so exhausting. But even if it&#8217;s physically and mentally exhausting, it&#8217;s also you always have these positive emotions afterwards because you talk to so many people. You see them, some even just once a year at WordCamp Europe because that&#8217;s the place where you all meet at that time and it&#8217;s just so positive to see everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, having conversations in person, which is so different from even if you do it in Slack or on Twitter or wherever else. So I was also very happy to see that booth of grade was fairly well visited and many people come around and ask what are we doing? What&#8217;s going on? What our next plans are? And also having conversations with other companies&#8217; developers. It&#8217;s like on everyday things. It&#8217;s not just about what are you doing and how can I copy you? Or whatever bad things you might think of. But it&#8217;s a very often very interesting conversations to hear other people&#8217;s point of views and see what are they struggling with, what have they success with? Yeah, overall it was just so much fun again and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, meeting all the people that you are friends with in the word community, but always mostly see on Slack or in GitHub on issues and PRs and all of a sudden you sit next to them and have coffee and eat with them. And it&#8217;s just almost like a big family reunion. But there were, I think about 70 sponsors there. So I think the WordPress communities is really coming back from what happened in the pandemic, really interesting to support those in-person meetings. And I&#8217;m not done yet, but I think playground is something that I&#8217;m going to play with quite a bit. And it was part of the keynote as well. There was also a talk by Adam Chylinski and he also had a question for Matt about documentation with playground. Yeah, so that&#8217;s certainly one takeaway for me, but I have so many conversations about things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if I get them all together into just a list to follow up on things. Yeah, so that&#8217;s about WordCamp Europe. I think there&#8217;s a lot of recap posts coming out of the community. I saw a few from sponsors already, also from community members that were new at WordCamp, I like that. I met quite a few people that were new to WordCamps at all, and they were really amazed on how the community reacted, how they get in contact very quickly with people and have the conversations be around what they care most about. Then that&#8217;s a business and WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So now we get to the announcements that I have for our listeners. If you listen to this over the weekend, there are two events that are happening next week. One is the developer hours, what&#8217;s new for theme developers in WordPress 6.6, that&#8217;s on June 25th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s Justin Tadlock and Nick Diego talking about anything and everything about WordPress 6.64. Block themes, website builders, and maybe also a little bit about plugin developers. If you listen to this episode after June 25th, you can always catch the recording on the YouTube channel of WordPress. There&#8217;s a developer hours playlist where you can also find the one for next week, but also the 24 previous developer hours, just in case you were looking for those. Also, next week, and you can join me, Isabel Bryson and others at the Hallway Hangout. When we explore the grid layouts, that&#8217;s on June 26th, a day later at 11 UTC. The developer hours are on 1500 UTC. But hallway hangouts are 11 UTC, and there will be a short demo of what&#8217;s coming to WordPress 6.6 and what cool layouts you can create with this new grid layout feature. And we also chat about what&#8217;s in the works for the following WordPress releases because the WordPress way is to release fast small version, a minimal viable product kind of thing, and then iterate involving the feedback from users and other developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in contrast to the developer hours that are entail formal presentations, Hallway Hangouts are more like an informal discussions to get feedback from the designers and from the developers and from site builders on what&#8217;s worked on and to see what people think about things. So these are two events for next week. Also, Hallway Hangouts are always recorded and will be shared in a recap post on the make core blog and also in the outreach channel. That&#8217;s fairly, it&#8217;s not new, but there was a FSE outreach experiment, but that was transformed into an official outreach channel where people who are not contributors can come in and ask questions. Ask if something that their experience is wanted or is the right way or if that&#8217;s a bug. That&#8217;s before you actually get your information together to file a bug report, you first need to know is it really a bug? What do other people think? And also if it&#8217;s not clear, if there&#8217;s some confusion. That really helps, those discussions really help inform the developers on what&#8217;s not working right yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most of the time we put the bug report together and put it together in the GitHub repo. Yeah, that&#8217;s about outreach channel in the WordPress make slack. Come and join us or just come in and if you have a question. That&#8217;s also where we announce the Hallway Hangouts the developer hours, and also share some links from GitHub repo about things that need to be discussion. There&#8217;s also a GitHub team where extenders signed up or are added to it that want to give feedback on work in progress. So Gutenberg developers can then just ping that team and say, &#8220;Well, we need some feedback here. Can you come in?&#8221; And right now there are 20 people in the team, but we can always use more because not everybody has time to answer the ping when it comes because we all have lives and we have work to do. So all right, you are in the group, Jessica? In the outreach group?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I&#8217;m in the outreach channel. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m in the team. Probably I&#8217;m in the block themers team. It&#8217;s a different one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s a different one. Yeah, but I can check and would you want to go on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Oh, for sure. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Okay. Yeah, then I&#8217;ll add you to it if you&#8217;re not-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I mean, I&#8217;ve been asking many questions in the outreach channel already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, so you said somebody needs to. You want to return the favor and give feedback on something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: If I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> &#8230; post my 2 cents, why not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, you have opinions. We&#8217;ll travel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.6</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, WordPress 6.6 beta 3 was released this week. And the post lists four different ways you can test the new version and it&#8217;s definitely time to go and make sure your sites plugins and themes are compatible. That&#8217;s always due diligence before a release. And if you do that and you report the bugs that you find. Well, what&#8217;s not working right, there might still be a chance to change it, but the window is closing. I hear rumblings that there will be a silent beta four because there were a few things that still needed another beta. But the release candidate is set for June 25th next week, release candidate one, which stops all development mostly, and one or two bug fixes might get in, but it&#8217;s also the time where the field guide comes out, and that&#8217;s also string freeze. So the translation teams of the 70 to 200 polyglots teams have a chance to translate the new version in their respective languages. So there string freeze, so there&#8217;s probably nothing&#8217;s going to change a lot after that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are four ways to test the version, and I think the easiest one is to use playground for it. There&#8217;s a link on it too. And if you use the playground plugin on your own site, you can actually create a sandbox of your current site so you don&#8217;t have to spin up a staging area or locally install and make all the copies and blah, blah, blah. So you install that. It&#8217;s still experimental so it might not work with your site, but if you use it, you can spin up a site and then add the new beta version to the playground and then you can test your site right there. So that&#8217;s definitely a great testing ground for playground. I say playground a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J<em>essica Lyschik:</em> It happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Have you experimented with playground and how you can use it for your development?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I have researched a bit about it, how we can use it actually for internal stuff at GREYD. An idea we came up with was for support, maybe if you need to quickly spin up a site and make sure that you can recreate this in a complete default state, for example. But that was shortly before WordCamp Europe, so we haven&#8217;t dug into it that much yet. But there are definitely ideas how we can make use of playground to also work within our company with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So I had an interesting conversation just this week with Beatrice Fialo and Sarah Norris. They were showing off the workflow that Autommattic uses for theme development and version control, and they start with Playground, install the Gutenberg plugin and create block theme plugin and then save everything through the create block theme plugin save. Because that allows you to save everything that&#8217;s in the database through the global styles and all the settings into the fire system of a theme. And then connecting playground to GitHub. It automatically uses the changes and creates a pull request on GitHub. And that was really, it&#8217;s almost like magic. I&#8217;m putting together a recap post for that, but that&#8217;s going to be on make core blog. But then the outreach channel, you can already see the videos and the discussion about that. So just a side note about playground and what you can do with it and how mind-boggling that can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> That&#8217;s also very interesting. I think. I&#8217;ll have to check that out because we did have some struggles on working with the great theme, when we prepared it for the repository. It&#8217;s like how do you bring those changes that someone makes in the editor inside the patterns, how do you actually bring that into version control? So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely something to check out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, one caveat, create block theme team that creates a block or works on the plugin. They haven&#8217;t integrated patterns yet, so the pattern saving that doesn&#8217;t work yet, but that&#8217;s definitely on the roadmap for one of the future versions, especially after WordPress 6.6 they&#8217;re looking at the sync pattern part. But they also probably need to wait until the core team has a first version about the theme related patterns, sync patterns in themes so they can…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; work with that as well, yeah. So there is a little bit of a time delay between what core is doing and then how the create theme block plugin team. Wow, that&#8217;s a muscle. Is catching up with it and working with it. They were ahead on the font library. They were testing the interfaces already in the plugin and then they had to take it out again once the core was having a block library feature in there. But we&#8217;re getting a little sidetracked. I just noticed playground, as I said, playground is what I&#8217;m going to say a lot about. But the dev notes for 6.6 are coming out already in preparation of the field guide, which will be published around, not always exactly when the release candidates publish, but it&#8217;s around next week. I will put in the show notes, the list of the already published dev notes. So we have four of them about the block editor. One is about the side wide images in WebPress 6.6, how you can…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Background images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> What did I say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> You said only side wide images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Yeah, I forgot the keyword in there. That was the background images in reference 6.6, how you can make it in theme JSON as well as online with a site editor, how you can add it. Also, the grade theme block plugin also saves that into the assets folder if you want to. There is a little feature for that already built in the plugin. Then the next one is about the theme.json version 3 schema, which will be expanded with features from 6.6. There&#8217;s a caveat there. If you are building themes that are used for older versions, don&#8217;t upgrade yet to your theme JSONs yet to version 3 because that only is for WordPress 6 and younger. And I think the dev note, I think it explains that quite a bit. So look at that. And then grid layout type summarizes all the things that come in for grid layout with Drag and Drop, with the Rowspan, Colspan and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we have the unified extensibility APIs in 6.6, that&#8217;s a little cryptic. And the unified word actually refers to unifying post editor and site editor. And the extensibility is about the slot fills or the inspector controls that in the sidebar. And now you can, as a plugin developer, your sidebar items will now also show in the post editor, site editor and template editor. So the only thing you need to do is figure out if you don&#8217;t want them to show in all the three of them, you need to figure out where in the editor experience your users are. So you can switch them on and off. But yeah, Riad has put in a comprehensive dev note about the slot fields that are available and where you find documentation about that. Anything strikes you as really, &#8220;Oh, I need to root this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>Oh, I definitely have to check on everything basically. So yeah, I&#8217;m looking forward to the background images. I think this may enhance the overall design process a little bit now that you can, and you do not have to make one group block around everything and then put a background image in there because that&#8217;s already possible. That you can now just define it&#8217;s like what? And do not have add extra blocks to tackle this. Theme.json version 3 is definitely interesting because that was what was I struggling with even during the speed build because of a mistake on my own, but not a big deal at all. I got around it. And yeah, Grid is something I&#8217;ve been looking forward to, so I&#8217;ve been already experimenting with it a bit. So I will definitely come next week to the Hallway Hangout, was it right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The Hallway Hangout, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, you will see me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And just as a side note, Hallway Hangout is something that tries to recreate the experience in a WordCamp hallway track where you just go from the sessions to the sponsor area and all that and you meet people in the hallway and you start conversations about things. So that&#8217;s the hallway, why we like that so much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are also other posts around 6.6 that are not necessarily dev notes for the release. There is a roster of design tools per block. It says it&#8217;s the 6.6 edition, but it&#8217;s a snapshot of all the additions since WordPress 6.6. And it gives you a table of all the core blocks and what they support. Do they support borders? Do they support the background image? Do they support shadows or alignment or typography color? Because not all the design tools are available for all blocks. And it&#8217;s always really hard to, not hard, but it&#8217;s an additional hassle to find out which one it is you put on list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Because sometimes you expect one setting at one block and it&#8217;s not there. And I remember we discussed this probably a year ago or even more, I don&#8217;t know. And I was like, &#8220;Ah, why isn&#8217;t there a list where I can see what&#8217;s available where?&#8221; And there was a list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Now is there…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> So thank you for working on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, you&#8217;re welcome. You&#8217;re welcome. Yeah. It gets me to study the source code of Gutenberg quite a bit on the block.json there to put this together. We are also working on an idea on making that available dynamically so not somebody has to go through all the code and because it&#8217;s already there. Riad had a nice site together that&#8217;s called Block Book as a prototype for that, but he of course didn&#8217;t have the time to pursue it any further. So maybe we&#8217;re going to revive that too, because that took quite a few hours to put together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>I&#8217;m sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Maybe I missed something too. Humans available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> We all make mistakes, no worries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s how I learn. Another post that&#8217;s out there is on the developer blog, that&#8217;s the introduction to the overrides in sync patterns by Nick Diego. And he put a nice introduction together and nice examples on how that works with the block bindings, API, and certainly something to look at. Although it&#8217;s mostly user interfaces, but the custom fields still need to be created and registered in PHP. So it&#8217;s a hybrid thing, but once they&#8217;re there, your users are enabled to assign patterns and to the custom fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third one that I wanted to point out and share in the show notes is the update on the data views by Anne McCarthy. And she just put together a very comprehensive post about what can be used, how you can use it, where the documentation is for, and also where you can follow along and leave feedback. So that&#8217;s certainly interesting for everyone. All right. Oh, I saw a prototype of a notes app for Max that uses Gutenberg outside of WordPress as well as the data components outside of WordPress just in a Mac app. That&#8217;s really cool that those things can happen without WordPress being involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Oh, interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, it&#8217;s bigger than we ever thought it would be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 18.6</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us to that latest Gutenberg plugin release, 18.6. And I think it&#8217;s always confusing for people to figure out, okay, which feature from the plugin goes into the next release? And the 6.6 release is between Gutenberg plugin release 17.8 to 18.5. So with 18.6, all the new features don&#8217;t go into 6.6. Some of the bug fixes will make it into 6.6 with a certain backport process that the core lead and the core editor leads from the release decide upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s new in the Gutenberg 16.6? I think the biggest piece for it is that the post content block, quote block and verse block, also getting the background image feature assigned to it. They&#8217;re supported now. So you can add background image and for a quote that&#8217;s really cool because that&#8217;s what you do for social image for instance. So you can put the quote in a block, put a background image there. Take a screenshot and share it on Mastodon or X or Blue Sky or something like that. And it really is cool. The same with verse block for some of our poets and the post content block is the block that is in the loop for…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Or in the templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, in the templates. Pulling out the content from a post. Of course the background image there shouldn&#8217;t probably it be a whole lot of distractions in there, but that&#8217;s a different story. Yeah, that&#8217;s a design tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> That&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Have you been waiting for this feature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I don&#8217;t think I would need it immediately, but maybe in the future it might become useful. I think the quote blocks one is definitely the one where you or where people will make most use out of it. But for the post content block, I mean you can imagine there might be some very subtle background like small dots or small dashes or something like that. It&#8217;s just giving a texture to it. Maybe an interesting design idea to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I have seen some websites. Not recently though, but it was more in the &#8217;90s and early &#8217;00s where there was a paper background on top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>Oh, yeah. I remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So maybe we get those back. Yeah, it&#8217;s a nostalgic way of thinking going things, yeah. Do you have seen anything in the change log that you wanted to point out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, I think this custom CSS handling to be consistent with block global sites. I did not notice it was inconsistent to be honest. But it&#8217;s a good change that things get aligned and work the same way as other parts of it. Because sometimes it&#8217;s the most frustrating thing when you expect something to work a certain way and it doesn&#8217;t, for whatever reason. There might be historical reasons or nobody thought of it yet. So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely an interesting change to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, definitely. Reducing the element of surprise that if something happens you didn&#8217;t expect and then you wonder why on, yeah. It also goes in together with the 18.5 feature that custom CSS styles are persistent through theme changes or style variation changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Style variation, yeah. Oh yeah, that was something I didn&#8217;t even realize before, but then when I thought of it like &#8220;What, why is this happening? Why?&#8221; But I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s now fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s fixed now. And that came from user feedback who were also surprised about a few things. And I think one of the start they&#8217;re like, &#8220;In WordPress, we start small and then iterate on things,&#8221; and sometimes I hear, &#8220;Well, nobody was asked what they think about it. And it started however, three, four months ago,&#8221; and that&#8217;s the place where feedback would&#8217;ve been needed and for the team to move forward or to get input there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New APIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would point this out that now there is a bootstrap, has nothing to do with the bootstrap on Twitter kind of thing. A basic action extensibility API for the data views for those who want to start working with that. And I quote from the release post, so it&#8217;s very early work. So the very early means inconsistent, not bug free surprise happenings. But the data views is the component that powers some post listing views available in the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only post listing but also page listing, pattern listings. In the future it will become an important part of the new admin design project. We all know that is coming. And now there is an API to allow registration of actions for different entities. Could be post types, could be other types of data representation by the listing. And right now the API is private in the Gutenberg plugin and will undergo further development and testing before being made public for third parties. So right now you can only look at it but not use it. Find out more in the pull requests that I will share. And also the recent update for data views we already talked about, but it&#8217;s the time where it starts and where you can read up about it. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s even behind an experiment flag, so we&#8217;ll figure that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bug Fixes<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there was in 18.6, there&#8217;s a ton of bug fixes. One is add custom CSS for block style variation. So block style variation is something that will come to 6.6 or is already in there that you can add additional block styles to custom blocks. And now you can also do custom CSS for that. Cool. In 18.6, so it&#8217;s not going to come to 6.6, did you look at that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>Yeah, it looks promising that you can add. So it&#8217;s basically adding custom CSS with the CSS property within theme JSON at that specific style variation. We have that for&#8230; I think for regular blocks it&#8217;s already available. I remember there&#8217;s something in Twenty Twenty Four that does exactly that. There&#8217;s just a little CSS snippet somewhere and the theme JSON, and again, I thought this was possible but obviously it was not for style variations. So yeah, that&#8217;s a cool change. So you can even more fine tune style variations if there&#8217;s a setting not existing for that specific CSS property yet. So that&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, you need a feature in a block that can be done with an animation that can be done with CSS, but it&#8217;s not available through theme.json or through any variables or something like that. Totally get it. So this is really cool. It opens up the editor to a lot of more creativity that is not yet built into the interfaces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experiments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about experiments, Riad Benguella is one of the lead architect on Gutenberg because the only thing that is not yet in the data views new data views interface is the post management. So when you add a post from the admin top, you get into the block editor. But if you&#8217;re in the menu and click on posts that you don&#8217;t get through the site editor, you always have to go back to the other WP admin menu and go to posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course that needs to migrate into the new design and that is now an experiment that you can switch on in Gutenberg and see what it is. Right now it&#8217;s only a one page and said, have I come to the post management? But that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s going to be in the future. Gutenberg plugin releases to find out how the post dashboard is going to look in there. Again, we start small and these are the beginning of things and there&#8217;s a lot of documentation changes as well, especially for the slot fields that are both editors that we are all put together so they can be linked off in the dev notes. And that&#8217;s pretty much it. I think we are all through the most important things from 18.6 unless you found something that stood out for yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Nothing in particular, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Cool. That brings us to two more things and one is that they are in the section of what&#8217;s an active development or what&#8217;s discussed. And I wanted to point people to a proposal about the bits as dynamic tokens by Dennis Snell. He put together a very technical proposal. So the first part of it is very good, explaining what it does. And so when blocks came to the scene, shortcuts were largely abandoned. But shortcuts had its values, have their values and they had many problems but they have value. And part of it is, so there was always a recommendation if you have a short code in your plugin, try to make a block out of it that has a functionality so it&#8217;s much user-friendly because most users don&#8217;t get the square brackets with the attributes and all that. They are not coders. So blocks is definitely a better interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sometimes you just can&#8217;t use it because it&#8217;s a subscriber&#8217;s name in an email form or it&#8217;s the author display in a query loop template or you want to have that name in a full sentence kind of thing. Or you want to date in a full sentence. So for those, there is no equivalent to short codes yet and this proposal is going to start exploring that bit of it, pun intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, sounds quite interesting. I mean maybe it has a little bit of overlap for the block bindings maybe in some, if you think of it, in some ideas like at the post authors display name in a query loop template. I mean, you can pull that basically from the database. So that would be something interfering with the block bindings feature that we have. So yeah, we have to check out, I think to discuss where are bits going, where are the block bindings going, what is the difference? Because I think even if you haven&#8217;t heard of block bindings yet, this can also be a confusing feature for people. So that&#8217;s definitely interesting to see. I mean, putting in some variables within existing text. That&#8217;s the interesting part of bits actually. So also where you&#8217;re pulling this from. So previously you would have to create a block and then maybe put in some magic to make that happen. And now if you would have a core feature doing that. Sounds great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So he had a little two paragraph thing, what about block bindings? To answer your thoughts, I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s entirely answered, but bits and block bindings he writes are related, but complimentary systems. Why block bindings can be thought of primarily as a developer oriented API where a developer can open up a given block or a subset of the block attributes to be replaced by some other source of data. Bits are primarily author oriented, giving end users the ability to add source content anywhere. There&#8217;s likely a large overlap in the data sources that power each system. Ideally the registered sources will be compatible with both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, sounds good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, if you have any other thoughts, the post is open for comments and there have been quite a few comments already. So that&#8217;s a great discussion to have. Don&#8217;t just read the block, also read the blog post, also read the comments with it so you get a better idea about it. And I shared of course in the show notes. And another thing that&#8217;s being discussed or worked on is, and we mentioned it before, is Sync patterns iteration for WordPress 6.7. So that&#8217;s the next version. And Riad Benguella had a proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is the need that sync patterns are available for theme developers that they can deliver those with their themes and also sync pattern overrides with that. And Riad Benguella, after Dan Danos wrote an iteration, what are the issues that are pattern oriented already in GitHub and what to make of it? There was a discussion among developers and then Riad put together a summary for that and that&#8217;s the comment that I will link to in the show notes where said, so what patterns are and how they should work. And I think it&#8217;s a good summary of what&#8217;s already possible and what needs to work on. So a pattern is always a pattern. It works the same regardless of where it comes from, comes from the theme, does it come from the user, does it come from a template part or something like that? Or does it come from a PHP or from HTML kind of thing. And can be registered with a theme file. Can be registered directly in the database. That&#8217;s the user part, sync to unsync.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he has the whole list of what a pattern is and how it functions and what is already existing and what is for the future or later. So I really like this post and he did a great job in putting it all together. Of course the discussion continues, hopefully with your input too. That&#8217;s why we talk about these things that are discussed so you can again be part of the discussion and chime in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is then coming to the end of the show of our 102nd episode. Jessica, thank you so much for being here. Is there anything that you want our listeners to know about and if they want to get in contact with you, how would they do it best?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: I think that&#8217;s it for today. So I mean I shared a lot about WordCamp Europe and what happened there. We had quite a few interesting topics on what&#8217;s going on in Gutenberg and their development. Yeah, you can find me on Twitter. I always call it&#8217;s still Twitter or it&#8217;s now called X, under my name Jessica Lyschik. Everything will be linked down below, don&#8217;t worry. Because I know my last name is a bit hard to pronounce or write down, but links will all be provided. And yeah, definitely reach out on Twitter or on Slack if you have questions. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Excellent. Yeah, thank you so much. So just for my, is it Jessica or Jessica?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: I don&#8217;t mind any. I&#8217;ve been used to both, so whatever you prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well I&#8217;m going either way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I&#8217;m fine with both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Good, thank you.

It could refer to metadata about a post, a post&nbsp;meta&nbsp;field, a stock price sourced from an API call, a countdown to a particular date, the local time of a given timestamp in the reader’s timezone, a plugin URL, a view counter, a render for a math formula, or any other bit of knowledge that is provided by the server when rendering a post.&#8221; Snell explained. If I understood the timeline correctly, some foundational work was already committed to Core to be in WordPress 6.6, so this feature can be tested in the next Gutenberg plugin releases.

Some are related to HeroPress, some not.  This one is not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somewhere around 2017 I went to a WordCamp in Florida.  It was probably Miami. I was a volunteer, and one of the things they asked me to do was be a room monitor at Kids Camp.  Just wander around and answer questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The kids were broken up into groups of three. There was one group of three boys, probably 7-9 years old. Two of the boys had long ago given up on computers and were tearing around the room having.a wonderful time as boys that age are wont to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But one boy was very intent on his computer. I went over and asked if he needed any help. He looked up at me and said &#8220;Well, I have WooCommerce all set up. and my product configured properly.  Can you show me how to connect it to Stripe?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was surprised to see the progress he made.  I told him that Stripe was something that involved banking information, and he&#8217;d probably need his parents involved.  His face fell and he sat wordlessly staring at his hands in his lap.  I asked if that was a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when he said &#8220;I made this site as a surprise for my Dad.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, putting user experience at the heart of your SEO strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Mina Tamang. Mina works as an SEO expert at Codewing Solutions. She has over six years of experience in the industry. In the past three years, she&#8217;s also become actively involved in the WordPress community, and she recently spoke at WordCamp Katmandu, which is where she lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Mina shares her journey and experiences in SEO, detailing how she discovered her love for the field, and how it has evolved over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a seasoned public speaker with experience in Toastmasters, and she brought her ideas to the stage at WordCamp Asia this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional SEO methods that can sometimes prioritize keyword research to achieve top search engine rankings, Mena champions a user first approach. She explains what she sees as the limitations of outdated practices, and emphasizes the importance of understanding, and addressing the pain points, and needs of your audience. Her central idea is always towards benefiting the end user rather than just appeasing search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the significance of integrating both traditional SEO rules, and user centric content creation, and get into the relevance of technical optimizations, speed factors, and the role of WordPress plugins. For those new to website building, she underscores the user-friendliness of WordPress and its compatibility with her SEO strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s 2024, and so we also discussed the growing influence of AI in content generation. Recognizing its utility, whilst cautioning on the necessity of maintaining a human element to ensure content is relatable and free from in accuracies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to refine your SEO strategies with a focus on longterm, user oriented, growth, whilst also navigating the complexities of modern tools and techniques, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick note before we begin, this is the last live recording from WordCamp Asia. There was quite a lot of background noise to contend with, and I&#8217;d done my best to clean up the audio and make it as easy to listen to as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Mena Tamang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Mina Tamang. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:45] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> I&#8217;m doing good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice to have you on the podcast today. You said this is your first podcast appearance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:50] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are you prepared for your talk at WordCamp Asia? Are you ready to go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:55] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So it&#8217;s actually tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:57] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Probably at 10:00 AM. Track four.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And have you done much public speaking in the past?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah, I have, I have. Because I&#8217;m engaged with the Toastmasters. So do you know anything about Toastmasters?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So actually it&#8217;s about making the people learn about the communication skill, as well as leadership skills. And there we also learn about public speaking, so I&#8217;ve done it. Not in the big stage, but smaller stage, but I&#8217;ve done it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So today we&#8217;re going to talk about SEO, and that is what your talk is about at WordCamp Asia. Before we do that, can you just tell us a little bit about your background, where you come from, what organisation you work for? Do you work in the SEO field? So just give us a little biography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:38] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Sure. So I am Mina Tamang, and I came from the land of Himalayas, so from Nepal. And for the past 6 years I&#8217;ve been doing the SEO, and SEO is like my passion. So I&#8217;ve started from the SEO, and I&#8217;m never thinking of like leaving it. So that&#8217;s what I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I work for the Codewing Solution, which is also a WordPress development company, that build WordPress themes, plugins. And I got to know about WordPress more in detail by joining this company, back in I think 2020, during the Covid time. And then I got to learn about the WordPress community. And I saw so many opportunities, and ever since then, I&#8217;ve been engaging with the WordCamps, either by being attendee or by the speakers, and that much more to explore. So yeah, I&#8217;m doing this thing right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, SEO is your day-to-day?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:29] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So the talk that you are putting on is all about this different way of doing SEO. You mentioned that there&#8217;s an old way, which obviously you don&#8217;t use, and there&#8217;s a new way. What is the old way, and why do you not do it that way anymore? What is it that&#8217;s wrong with that, and what&#8217;s your new way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:48] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So when I started doing SEO, so what I was taught was, it&#8217;s a search engine optimisation. So we need to rank website on top. Maybe number one. And then it&#8217;ll help to increase traffic on our website. And that will lead to the business success, or whatever the goal is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s what people think still now, and that&#8217;s what I was taught. And that&#8217;s a very vanity things like, what people think and feel about SEO, it&#8217;s all about ranking, and about the traffic. But it&#8217;s not. That&#8217;s the old way of SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now, those ranking and those traffic are just numbers. What we need to focus is on the business goal. So let me go more detail. There&#8217;s three types of SEO. There is a black hat SEO, grey hat SEO, and white hat SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we follow all the rules of Google&#8217;s, or any search engines, that&#8217;s a white SEO. And in white SEO we talk about page optimisations, technical optimisations, speed factors, and backlinks, and many more things, content creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there is a black hat, which is like doing opposite of what you need to be doing. It&#8217;s basically like breaking all the rules and laws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a grey hat, the middle part. So mix of the white and the black. So that&#8217;s what people think about SEO. And there are a lot of people who do white, there are a lot of people do black, and the grey, but I&#8217;m not talking about those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I&#8217;m talking about is, the people think that SEO is all about ranking and increase the traffic, but that&#8217;s wrong. Because when you do that, you prioritise the search engine. Let&#8217;s say Google. You are working for Google, not for your audience. And your audience is people, not the bots. So what you need to do is to put your user first. Think about the pain points, and their needs. So if people are searching for how to use, for example, mobile, then selling your phone directly is not your main thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First you need to educate them. How that phone is going to be useful for them in the day-to-day daily uses. So that&#8217;s how you will be dealing with the SEO. So that&#8217;s why I wanted to. And in my new way of doing SEO, my focus is always on the users. So that&#8217;s what wanted to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So if we do things in the old way, and we regard the whole project of SEO of getting to the top of the search ranking, and we want to be number one so that we get discovered more often. The rules for doing that are obvious, well, not obvious, but everybody has slowly learned what those rules are, we&#8217;ve got plugins in WordPress to make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does your technique, well, is it easier to do your technique? It certainly sounds more human to do your technique. But, does it have the same impact? If I follow your template, the way that you are going to tell us that you are doing SEO, will I still rise to the top of the search ranking? Because it kind of feels like that&#8217;s always the point. You want to be number one. Does it work, your technique, to get us to number one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:48] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yes. So my point is, we don&#8217;t want to be number one. Because being a number one does not guarantee for your business success, or whatever your metrics is. For example, if I&#8217;m selling a product, and my goal is, or my main target is to sell my product, right? And I&#8217;m ranking on all the keywords that I wanted, but my business success, the metrics, that goal is not happening. So what&#8217;s the point of being number one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can be still in the number one, and also drive the more sales. For that, we need to focus on the users. I&#8217;m not talking about doing all the manual things. We do take help of tools, like plugins. For example, Yoast. But whatever we do, the focus should be done whatever, like, for example, when you do the content creation, if I give you a content that is all written by the AI, and does not meet your pain points, would you converting to my customer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So their needs and the human intellect don&#8217;t necessarily clarify what works for you. For my customers, what are the pain points? So that needs to be done by the human. If it&#8217;s done by the human, they will actually know the pain points. And we&#8217;ll obviously take the help of tools, and plugins, and anything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, is it even fair to call this SEO? Because if you&#8217;re not really putting a great deal of thought into the search engine, SEO obviously stands for Search Engine Optimisation, can your system even fairly be called SEO, because you&#8217;re not really giving too much thought about where you&#8217;re going to end up in search?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:16] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Okay, so let me clarify that. So yes, I&#8217;m obviously working for the SEO. There are certain rules like, when we talk about SEO rules, there&#8217;s a meta title, descriptions, and there are also link, and there also keywords. I&#8217;m not teaching all those things. But whatever I do, I keep in mind the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a time when people used to stuff keywords within a content at massive numbers. That used work. But does that work now? It doesn&#8217;t. So there are certain rules that need to be followed, and we will obviously follow those. But whenever doing the marketing, whether it&#8217;s content through videos or everything, we put the user first. And Google itself put the user first. They want the user to get the useful information from the good website, not from the spammy website, that does everything for the search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there comes the trust factor. So, yes, it&#8217;s called SEO, we do follow all the rules, because I&#8217;m just talking about the content creations, there are other factor as well. When we do the SEO, we also look after the technical things. We have to collaborate with developers, there are changes needed. Okay, this one is not good by looking at the user experience factor, like speed, the designs, everything there is. So we do that as well. And when it comes to doing the content creation, I&#8217;m focusing on that part. So in that sense, we need to put the user first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Give us an example of how you actually do this. So let&#8217;s take the example, you mentioned mobile phones, but we could do anything. You&#8217;re obviously thinking about the purchaser at the end, the customer, the client, whatever it may be. Just talk us through the process that you are going through in your company, to make this all happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:53] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Okay. So for example, my company sells product, right? So I need to put that, my product, to the audience. People need to know we exist. For that, obviously we will follow all the SEO rules. We need to put the most important keywords within a title, my description within a content, and we will also do the content marketing, video marketing. So then, when we emphasise or highlight the features, we don&#8217;t focus on them, we focus more on the benefits. So, how the product is going to help them. I&#8217;ll give you a simple example, not about a product, but real example. So, do you know about back scratcher?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I can imagine. So something to literally scratch your back with. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:34] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So maybe there was a time it was not discovered, not made, so people used their hands to scratch the back, right? So then they made the product. Now, how did the company sell this? Maybe in those time, there was no internet, or online things to promote things, right? So maybe they sell down the street by showing that back scratcher, doing by themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, how did the audience connect it? Okay, there&#8217;s a thing, like this long thing, a stick that can be used to scratch our back. And they did it with their pain points. There are parts that we can&#8217;t reach with our hand, right? That&#8217;s a simple product in itself. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to tell. Whenever we do the marketing of our product, we need to emphasise the benefits instead of features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Your process is about choosing the right language, and instead of concentrating relentlessly, which is I think what most people do, on keywords and all of that stuff, you are explaining, and in this case it&#8217;s a product, back scratcher, you are explaining the benefits. And you believe that by just explaining the benefits, you can creep, well, not creep up the search ranking because that isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;re trying to do, but you can become discovered because you are using this language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:47] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah. And that&#8217;s what I want to focus in is the word of mouth. Because the person, like the product, he is going to obviously tell to his friends, colleague, or anyone that this product is useful. Also I&#8217;m pointing out, and this might not fall under SEO, or beyond the SEO, but it goes along with the SEO, because the SEO doesn&#8217;t fall under the marketing or the sales, it&#8217;s in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we work with sales team as well as marketers, our work is that. So I wanted to focus that word of mouth is a good way of promoting the market. And other thing is we can focus on all the stuff as well. Content, video, and obviously there&#8217;s a backlink, but that also comes with the, there&#8217;s two things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can do it by paid, or the free one. Free is organic, it&#8217;s quite difficult to do it. And we also need to consider where the business stands. Is it just in the oldest days of the market? Is it in the mid, or is it in the exploring stage? We also need to consider those things as well. So there are a lot of things to consider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. When you explain this to your clients, I&#8217;m guessing that most clients will have this notion of, well, no, no, no, we need to use loads of keywords, and we need to ram the keywords in as much as possible, because that&#8217;s the understanding of SEO that they have. Do you get a lot of pushback from your clients when you explain, no, no, no, we&#8217;re not doing any of that, we&#8217;re just going to concentrate on the benefits, and explain them in easy to understand language, and hopefully get discovered. And a bit of word of mouth as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:12] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah, a lot, a lot. Because as I said earlier, people think SEO is about keywords, ranking and traffic. So whenever they ask for the report, and we have to tell them, okay, we have this much as traffic, this much conversion, but they want certain keywords to be ranked. And we say them, look, here&#8217;s your report, this is looking good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And SEO is something that does not go at once at all. It&#8217;ll not skyrocket at once, it&#8217;ll take time. So that thing is very difficult to make them understand, that SEO takes time, and ranking for every keyword is not the main goal. Our main goals should be on the business goal, that is to sell the service, product, or anything else that they want us to do. And it&#8217;s very hard, and we need to educate them as well. Look, here my pain point is, they don&#8217;t understand the SEO. What is SEO? And we need to educate them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, because I can imagine that, if you&#8217;ve launched a client website, and we&#8217;ll use the example of a back scratcher, if they&#8217;re selling back scratches, within few weeks your customer is going to be going to a search engine, let&#8217;s use the example of Google, and they&#8217;re going to be typing in a whole range of things, they will hit the return key on their computer, and they&#8217;re hoping to see their website on the first page. Number one, number two, number three. They&#8217;re hoping to see that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From what you are saying, you are telling your clients, look, don&#8217;t obsess about that. Stop worrying about becoming first page, number one, number two, whatever it may be. Let&#8217;s concentrate just on making the messaging right. And then if we do that all correctly, it should just follow on that the sales will begin. I&#8217;m guessing that your clients do come to you and say, well, where are we? We&#8217;re not anywhere on the search. I&#8217;m guessing that happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:46] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah. So, as I said, when we focus on the benefits and on the users, with time it&#8217;ll automatically rank. So see if we start with the focus on ranking, then that might be a temporary success. It won&#8217;t be the permanent. But if you focus on the user and benefits, with time our website will obviously rank, because there&#8217;s a factor called user experience and the SEO, and that matters a lot for most of the search engine. So ultimately, we will rank as well, and also get the organic, consistent, organic traffic. So that&#8217;s my goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, it sounds like this is a much more simple approach in many ways. It&#8217;s more straightforward, because you&#8217;re not obsessing about, I don&#8217;t know, spreadsheets with all the keywords in, and writing down the numbers of clicks, and all of that. All of that goes out the window, and you&#8217;re just concentrating on easy, straightforward language. And it&#8217;s a long game. You&#8217;re not trying to do this in the next week or month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are saying to your customers, okay, let&#8217;s look at it more over a year, or two years, or something like that. Right, okay. So it&#8217;s a much, much longer game, but easier to do, because really all that you&#8217;re doing is worrying about the language, right? So it&#8217;s easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:51] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah, it might be. I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s easier, but we have to be consistent because people might get frustrated about not getting the result. So like there are people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yes, I can imagine they would, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:02] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Especially clients. They worry about, where is the results? Where are we? What are the status about the rankings, traffic? But it takes time, so it&#8217;s for the long run. And we need to be consistently hoping that it will go right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And do the search engines, more and more, take other metrics? So it&#8217;s not just the keywords. You mentioned things like the performance of the website so, you know, we&#8217;ve got things like core web vitals, and all of the bits and pieces that are rolled into that. The speed of the site, obviously the quality of the content itself. There&#8217;s more to the search engine than just keywords. It&#8217;s about the performance, it&#8217;s about the way the site is designed, it&#8217;s about the speed of the server, all of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:41] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah. So what Google is trying to do, it&#8217;s trying to help the users by implementing all those factors for all the SEOs and the business owners. What they want is that users get best results from the good website. And for that, all these factors are important, like for the speed. So if your website is not going to load, then people will obviously get frustrated and not get the result, and they have to go from one to another place. And that will obviously take their time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when it comes to other content creations, if they are going to website to get information to solve their problems, and they&#8217;re not getting it. So that means, ultimately, Google wants to help its users, and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re implementing all those rules. And all those are just factors. I wouldn&#8217;t say that&#8217;s a ranking factors. People take it as a ranking factor, but when we look after all those things like speed, core web vitals, it doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because when you focus on making all the factors perfect, you might fall into practice of making like your website less useful for users. For example, you&#8217;ve made your core web vitals like a 100% score, but certain features of your website does not load while doing that, which was very important to your audience to engage with their product. Then losses are yours. So we need to mention at least balance. So we need a balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are at a WordPress conference. Are you using WordPress tools? I think you used word Yoast I think a minute ago. So, is your approach based on WordPress plugins that you use, or is this just about using the block editor, creating paragraphs, and writing text which is adjacent to whatever it is that you are trying to market and sell?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So I am using plugin. WordPress is a lot easier for the beginners. Those people who does not know about anything about technology, about how to build a website, and how to run it. So it&#8217;s quite helpful tool. And I am using it, and I&#8217;m also using for my clients, and for all the people that I tell how to build a website. And it&#8217;s definitely going to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually it&#8217;s not just for the WordPress, it&#8217;s for all the other platform as well. The process, the rules are same for every website. Either it&#8217;s a big, either it&#8217;s small. What&#8217;s it built on? It&#8217;s either the WordPress or Shopify. People call it Shopify SEO. The process, the rules are same. Just we are taking the help of the plugins and the other tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So there&#8217;s no particular plugin that you recommend over another one. WordPress plugins will work for your approach, and you&#8217;re concentrating on the words that you create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:04] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah, you can use it. I would definitely recommend using Yoast or Rank Math, for those who don&#8217;t know much about SEO, but don&#8217;t prioritise it to make it a perfect score. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re in the era of AI, and people are making lots and lots of content nowadays with AI. You go to OpenAI, or some other AI, and you ask it to produce a 10,000 word article about back scratchers and it will do it. And will do what looks like a good job. My intuition though is that, it&#8217;s probably not doing you any favors, because the content it creates is maybe not actually very human, or potentially is full of inaccuracies. What are your thoughts on AI created content, and how that might affect your ability to rise into the search results?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:51] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Okay, so, AI tool is like our arms and legs. It&#8217;s a bit like that for now. And I&#8217;m also using AI tool, but to clarify on my strategy. AI tool can definitely give you whatever you search. Like what is this? It&#8217;ll give you answer. How can I do this? It&#8217;ll give you answer. But what doesn&#8217;t it give you is the personal experiences. And, how do we more connect with the audience naturally? It&#8217;s through the experiences, the learning. So that&#8217;s what I think, in my opinion, lacks the AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m sort of thinking to moving the strategy towards that. Sharing the experience, getting more the personal level. So in that sense, we can obviously, at least do the good SEO without AI tool. I&#8217;m not saying that staying away. I&#8217;m also using AI to create the content. But, for example, you are also using AI tool. I&#8217;m also using AI tools, for the same topic to write a content. It might give you the similar content, right? So now, how am I going to compete with you? We&#8217;ll get the same answer, similar. So that&#8217;s where I do my strategy, the new strategy, of putting my personal experience, and some of my human intellect and critical judgment. That&#8217;s what I do. I will obviously, take the help of AI. I&#8217;m not staying away from it, but I&#8217;m using it in a more creative way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So you are providing additional content, which is, I don&#8217;t know, you&#8217;re teaching people, back scratcher is kind of a difficult example because I don&#8217;t really know that there&#8217;s a lot to say about a back scratcher. But the point is, you are going above and beyond what the AI would just give you. And you are saying be helpful, educate the audience, give them things that they want, you know, give them takeaways, give them things that they can enjoy, give them blog posts that are actually meaningful. So being helpful on your website is the goal, over just pure SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you use AI to search for things these days? So I&#8217;ve really dropped Google as my search engine. I mean, we can go into some of the other search engines that are around there. But I&#8217;m increasingly finding myself using AI to find what I want on the internet. So rather than get me to a particular website, if it&#8217;s a question, I just want the answer to come out. So I go to OpenAI, and I ask it a direct question, and it gives me the answer. So that&#8217;s the other way around. Rather than using AI to create content, do you see that search engines are becoming less visited by people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:14] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> For now, it&#8217;s not. Maybe in the next 2030, I&#8217;m not sure about that. For now, for the short answer that could be answered within like two or three paragraph, people will obviously choose the AI over the search engine. But when it comes to using something like, for example, how to take a photograph, a good photograph, then I might need to check the videos, instead of getting the answers. And they would obviously need a tutorial, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for that, people are still using the search engine, as well as the AI tool. But for the long answer, that needs more tutorial, more of like how to do it, people are using search engine. And for now it&#8217;s okay. I don&#8217;t know about the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the Google is promoting the AI, like there&#8217;s a generative AI. Whatever I will search something, keywords, they will give the answers automatically. But when I have to use any product, how to use it, like if there&#8217;s something problem with my product, any things in my daily life, for example, I crack my phone screen, then how to repair it. Maybe for that I will be using the search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right. Do you concentrate with your clients, do you only talk about Google with your clients? Because I know that there&#8217;s quite a few options out there these days. You know, you&#8217;ve got Bing. There&#8217;s one called Kagi, which I&#8217;ve used quite a few times. I&#8217;ve used Duck Duck Go quite a few times. Is it all about Google? Is Google the thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:31] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> No. So when I talk about search engine, I talk about everything. Though we do mention Google most of the time, because it is the most used search engine, right? So when I say search engine into the non-tech people, they would say Google. So I have to mention it Google. But I haven&#8217;t used other search engine much, like Kagi. I think it&#8217;s a premium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, Kagi you pay for. Duck Duck Go is free though. It&#8217;s ad supported, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:54] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Well, I haven&#8217;t used those, but my priority is not search engine. For example, if I put the Google as a priority search engine, as I said, I would not prioritise more on the search engine, more on the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m a client, and I come to you, and I&#8217;ve got a shop, and I&#8217;m selling, oh I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say mobile phones. We are going to sit down, and we&#8217;re going to have a conversation about, okay, we want a website, we would like it to be discovered. What are the kind of things that you are telling me to go away and do? You&#8217;ve mentioned videos. You&#8217;ve mentioned things like, well, I&#8217;m guessing blog posts and things like that. What&#8217;s the kind of content that you want me, your client to make, create?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:32] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Okay. So first we need to clarify that SEO is not for every type of website. We need to understand the market, so where the audience is. For the phone, it might be the more of like social media, videos, because people want to see how their phone will look, how it&#8217;ll function, rather than like looking at the text. They would prefer the video, visuals. So we need to understand that as well. So first we need to understand the market, your niche. Then only we could recommend what works best for you. And for the example of phone, it&#8217;s going to be all of them. It&#8217;s also the text, the blogging, the videos, and also the email marketing. Everything will work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So let&#8217;s pick a different product then. So not the mobile phone. Let&#8217;s think about, oh I don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;ve got a bookshop. You know, we&#8217;ve got physical books, people come in to the shop and they buy things from us. It&#8217;s a little bit more of an old technology. You know, maybe there&#8217;s less video in there. So how would that be adapted? Bookshop against mobile phone. What would be the difference that you would be getting customers to think about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:28] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So the audience would obviously be the little bit smaller compared to phone, when it comes to book maybe. For the book, I would recommend to do the social media, blogging, and the email marketing, because people do search books. In my country, in Nepal, there are a lot of books that is very hard to find. And then they need to connect with the bookshop owners frequently. And that&#8217;s where the social media would be much easier to communicate with them faster. So I would recommend the social media instead of, if I have to choose SEO and social media for the book sales shop, I would prefer this social media. So that&#8217;s what I would recommend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It really is a case of talking to the client, and each person that comes through your company&#8217;s door, you have a different set of things that you&#8217;re encouraging them to do. So it may be YouTube videos, it may be it email, it may be blog posts. And depending on what the product is, you are going to get them to make those bits of content specifically based upon the product that they&#8217;ve got. Right, okay. So it seems like it&#8217;s the long game. You&#8217;re in this, and it&#8217;s going to take a year, two years, and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s working for your company, this strategy, I&#8217;m guessing. You know, you&#8217;ve got clients coming back, and they&#8217;re seeing, not looking at the search results, but they&#8217;re seeing that their website is effective for them, and they can tell themselves confidently, okay, we paid your company to help us get the products that we&#8217;ve got sold, and it&#8217;s working?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:49] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So I don&#8217;t do much of client work, because I work for the company, and that have their own product. So actually we sell our own product, and it&#8217;s working good. Actually is all about trial and testing thing. We need to do AB testing a lot. One strategy is working, that might not work for the other websites. We need to do test again and again. So we do the testing things, and it&#8217;s working fine for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone have their own style of working. Even if the rules and the format are the same thing, but I would prefer something else. Like, when I write, create content, I like to put it in the story way. And some other companies might not like it. So there&#8217;s a working style difference, but, yes, it&#8217;s working for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Obviously this is a WordPress podcast that we&#8217;re recording at the moment. Do you use WordPress for all of the sites that you build? Is that part of the company&#8217;s mission, or does this strategy that you&#8217;ve got work with any platform? You know, be that Squarespace, or Wix, or whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:40] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s worked for everyone. It&#8217;s worked for every platform. The SEO is not just for the WordPress. But yes, I am using WordPress and our products is based on WordPress, and all the clients, our customers are all WordPress based. So we do recommend the WordPress plugins, all the things. But it works for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the doing things is different. For the WordPress, we use plugin like Yoast or Rank Math, to do all the SEO stuff. In their platform, for example, Shopify, they might have their own tools or plugins to do that same thing in a different product name. So it&#8217;s the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So what is the company that you work for? Where can we find you? Do you have an email address, or a social handle that you&#8217;d like to share?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:19] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah. I work for the Codewing Solution. You can go and search, it&#8217;s codewing.co. And we are also on social media, Facebook, Instagram, and we also have YouTube channels, and all have dedicated product as well. And those have also the social media handles, and also the websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s all the questions that I&#8217;ve got. Is there anything that you think we&#8217;ve missed, that you&#8217;d to address?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:41] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> I think that&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If that&#8217;s the case, I will say thank you very much for chatting to me today, Mina.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"ticss-c8b411f0\">[00:30:46] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Thank you for having me. It was actually a great opportunity to connect with other people, because this is something that I would not get the chance to meet you, and talk with you as well. I definitely grab the opportunity.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Mina Tamang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mina works as an SEO expert at Codewing Solutions. She has over 6 years of experience in the industry. In the past 3 years, she’s also become actively involved in the WordPress community, and she recently spoke at WordCamp Kathmandu which is where she lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Mina shares her journey and experiences in SEO, detailing how she discovered her love for the field and how it has evolved over time. She&#8217;s a seasoned public speaker with experience in Toastmasters, and she brought her ideas to the stage at WordCamp Asia this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional SEO methods that can sometimes prioritise keyword research to achieve top search engine rankings, Mina champions a user-first approach. She explains what she sees as the limitations of outdated practices and emphasises the importance of understanding and addressing the pain points and needs of your audience. Her central idea is always towards benefitting the end-users rather than just appeasing search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the significance of integrating both traditional SEO rules and user-centric content creation, and get into the relevance of technical optimisations, speed factors, and the role of WordPress plugins. For those new to website building, she underscores the user-friendliness of WordPress and its compatibility with her SEO strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s 2024, and so we also discuss the growing influence of AI in content generation, recognising its utility while cautioning on the necessity of maintaining a human element to ensure content is relatable and free from inaccuracies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to refine your SEO strategies with a focus on long-term, user-oriented growth, while also navigating the complexities of modern tools and techniques, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/\">Toastmasters</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://codewing.co/\">Codewing Solutions</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://yoast.com/\">Yoast</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rankmath.com/\">Rank Math</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/en-GB/\">OpenAI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kagi.com/\">Kagi</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">DuckDuckGo</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Jun 2024 13:39:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WordPress Foundation: Announcing the 2024 Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship Recipient: Cynthia Norman\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/?p=1186809\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/news/2024/announcing-the-2024-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-recipient-cynthia-norman/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3416:\"<p><br />In 2015, the WordPress Foundation <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/\">established an annual memorial scholarship</a> to honor the memory of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/11/people-of-wordpress-kim-parsell/\">Kim Parsell</a>, a beloved and influential contributor to the WordPress community.

When I got to BobWP on Community, I noted that this one is a bit of an exception and I felt I had dive a bit into it by itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially BobWP on Community has replaced WooBits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now WooBits had a nice and complicated life span. The first thoughts were to use it for updates at Woo and other news around the space. In the beginning, news outside of WooCommerce.com was few and far between. I&#8217;m sure things were going on somewhere, somehow, but not matter how much I stayed on top of it, well, it wasn&#8217;t working out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then it went to commentaries, bits and pieces of stuff I found, and a lot of meandering. I even podcasted a few times about changes in WooBits so if you have been a listener long, that may sound vaguely familiar to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I went as far as considering pulling out single audio tips from episodes and sharing them as WooBits. But that turned into quite a task and more times than not, standalone tips weren&#8217;t the same as hearing the conversation that surrounded it. Audio bits just didn&#8217;t quite do it for me when it came to content here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The a couple of things happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, I was noticing that the WooBits where I did commentary on felt more in place to the content I wanted to share. But somehow it still didn&#8217;t make sense, titled WooBits. Although I&#8217;m sure no one gave it a second thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that happened was a bit more eye opening came to me indirectly, so bear with me on this. Over on my site BobWP.com, well I blog occasionally. Always telling myself I will blog more. And then realizing two months have slipped by. A couple of times I have threatened, or should I say, shared, that I would start a podcast on BobWP. Yes yet another podcast. Well, who was I fooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time slipped by and as that thought drifted further from my mind, and as I felt less interested in finding that sweet spot for WooBits, suddenly something occurred to me. Or actually two things</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, why reinvent the wheel, or the platform</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Was I trying to fit something in only thinking of the show title, WooBits?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, duh, What if I changed WooBits to more of a community commentary that would be my weekly piece. No WooBits, but instead BobWP on Community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lesson learned here. And something I don’t normally do as I am someone always to drop something that doesn’t work and pivot when needed. But in the end it was such a simple solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I’m sure there have been instances in your own business, or where you work or even your personal life where you just kept something for too long for the wrong reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I hope you join me as I share my own community thoughts moving forward. And no better time to start this change until Do the Woo 4.0 is now live. Cheers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The long and winding road of WooBits has ended. And a lesson learned.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Jun 2024 08:41:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Gravatar: Level Up Your Conference Game: Effective Networking Tactics\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=1518\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/16/how-to-network-at-a-conference/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15357:\"<p>Walking into a networking event can be one of the most daunting experiences for new networkers. Beforehand, you often ask yourself a hundred and one questions about what to say, how to say it, and how to approach people. But don’t worry—we can help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking is extremely important in the professional world. It allows for knowledge sharing, collaboration, and forming partnerships that are hard to find elsewhere. In this article, we&#8217;ll share advice and strategies to boost your confidence, establish meaningful connections, and make the most out of networking events. Whether you are an experienced professional or a first-time attendee, let’s see how you can maximize your impact at conferences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exploring top tips for networking at a conference</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Have a clear agenda</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you define your goals upfront. These might include investigating new trends, connecting with specific individuals, or promoting your product/service. Setting these goals lets you focus your efforts and measure your success. Ask yourself: <em>What do you want from this networking event?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Research attendees and participants in advance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before attending a professional conference, have a close look at the conference agenda and attendee list to pinpoint key speakers, industry leaders, and influencers. Researching speakers and attendees beforehand makes it easy to figure out who you should be speaking to! Research key people on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/login\">LinkedIn</a> and other relevant social media profiles. A great strategy for this is to see if they have a <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> profile, as this will contain all their social media information and other important links and give a solid overview of what they do.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"441\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.gif?w=600\" alt=\"Nigel Cameron’s Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-1520\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/nigelcameron\">Nigel Cameron’s Gravatar profile</a> provides a snapshot of his engagement in technology and policy discussions, which could be important for meaningful interactions at the conference. Establish clear goals for whom to meet, which sessions to attend, and the outcomes you aim to achieve. This preparation will ensure your event time is productive and impactful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Establish connections beforehand and create a meeting schedule</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan ahead by contacting potential connections via email or social media. Use platforms like LinkedIn to introduce yourself and express interest in meeting. You can also use <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/\">Google Calendar</a> or conference apps to schedule face-to-face meetings. This means you won’t miss anyone you plan to talk to, nor do you have to awkwardly approach them!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strengthen existing connections</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While forming new connections is important, don&#8217;t forget to nurture existing relationships. Reinforcing pre-existing ties can lead to deeper professional ties and opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>After an initial meeting, follow up with a personalized message referencing previous interactions, shared interests, and potential for future collaboration. You can take it a step further by scheduling a one-on-one meeting during the conference and using that time to catch up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Make time for new networking opportunities</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-structured schedule is great, but allowing room for spontaneous networking opportunities is equally important. These unplanned moments can often lead to the most valuable connections and insights.<br /><br />Be open to impromptu meetups or casual conversations in common areas like coffee shops, lounges, or hallways. If you overhear a discussion that piques your interest, please join in and contribute your thoughts politely. These organic interactions can generate genuine connections and reveal shared interests or challenges.<br /><br />Another way to embrace spontaneity is to participate in conference-specific social media hashtags. Many attendees use these hashtags to share insights, ask questions, and arrange informal gatherings to further professional relationships, which brings us to the next point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Leverage social media to amplify your conference presence</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Identify the official platforms and social profiles used by the conference, and engage with them to maximize your visibility. Share compelling content that resonates with your audience throughout the event, including session takeaways, personal insights, and behind-the-scenes moments. Actively engage with posts from speakers, attendees, and influencers to cultivate meaningful online interactions that can translate into valuable offline connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When live-tweeting or providing real-time updates, balance digital engagement and in-person networking. Remember, while social media offers a powerful platform for extending your reach, face-to-face interactions remain essential for building lasting relationships and maximizing the impact of your conference experience. Using social media, you can amplify your presence, create meaningful connections, and leave a lasting impression on virtual and physical audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Prepare conversation starters and ask leading questions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Engaging in meaningful conversations at conferences begins with the right conversation starters. Personalized openers are more impactful than generic ones, as they demonstrate genuine interest and help you stand out. One of the most important things you can do is to make sure you appear curious and knowledgeable by asking informed questions about current industry trends or recent publications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the event, research industry news and trends to develop conversation starters tailored to different professionals you might meet, such as developers, executives, or marketers. Consider asking leading questions that prompt thoughtful discussions and enable you to better understand the other person&#8217;s perspective and challenges. Here are some examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For developers</strong>: &#8220;I noticed your recent project on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>. Can you tell me more about the technology stack you used and any challenges you faced?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For executives</strong>: &#8220;I read about your company&#8217;s recent expansion into international markets. What drove that decision, and what are your goals for the future?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For marketers</strong>: &#8220;I saw your recent article on social media strategies. How will emerging platforms impact marketing efforts in the coming year?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, ask questions that show genuine interest in the other person&#8217;s work and experiences!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Refine your elevator pitch</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Crafting an elevator pitch is a great way to make a memorable first impression at conferences. Start by determining the core message of your professional narrative. Ask yourself what sets you apart and makes you memorable. Focus on your value to potential contacts or employers, highlighting how your skills and expertise can benefit them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your pitch concise, aiming for 30 to 60 seconds to respect the listener&#8217;s time and maintain their attention. Ensure your pitch is adaptable, allowing you to tailor it to different audiences and situations for maximum impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Plan your exit strategy</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a solid exit plan is not just about escaping a failed conversation; it&#8217;s a crucial aspect of professional networking that allows you to gracefully transition between interactions and make the most of your time at a conference. A well-crafted exit strategy enables you to smoothly end conversations, both successful and unsuccessful, while maintaining positive connections and your reputation. Knowing when to politely wrap up an interaction is just as important as starting one, as overextending a conversation can be detrimental. Clear exit strategies and steps can minimize disruptions, help you adapt strategically to new possibilities, and ensure you have the opportunity to connect with a diverse range of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to do it right:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Understanding social cues</strong>: Read body language and conversational cues to gauge when to exit a conversation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Creating natural transition points</strong>: Guide conversations toward a courteous conclusion by finding natural pauses or wrapping up current topics.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Offering a tangible follow-up</strong>: Suggest specific ways to reconnect, such as exchanging emails or connecting on LinkedIn, and use tools like <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> to streamline the process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Excusing yourself politely</strong>: Use phrases like &#8220;It&#8217;s been great chatting, but I don&#8217;t want to monopolize your time&#8221; to signal departure graciously.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Timing your departure</strong>: Find the right moment to leave, neither lingering too long nor exiting abruptly, to ensure a positive impression.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use Gravatar as your contact-sharing app</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"373\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-8.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar profile example\" class=\"wp-image-1521\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> as your go-to contact-sharing tool can revolutionize your conference experience. Gravatar is a platform that allows you to create a comprehensive professional profile linked to your email address. This profile contains essential information about yourself, including your photo, bio, and contact details, making it an ideal touchpoint for networking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s why Gravatar stands out and how to make the most of its features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Universal profile consistency</strong>: Gravatar ensures consistency across multiple platforms with a single, universal profile image and information. This unified presence enhances <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/10/personal-branding-tools/\">personal branding</a>, making it easier for new contacts to recognize and recall you amidst the conference crowd.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"429\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-9.png?w=660\" alt=\"Using links in your Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-1522\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Displaying social information and relevant links</strong>: Integrate direct links to your relevant social networks (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/login\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/?lang=en\">X/Twitter</a>) within your Gravatar profile. This allows contacts to explore your online identity and connect with you across various platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"259\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-10.png?w=660\" alt=\"Adding contact information\" class=\"wp-image-1523\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Adding contact details</strong>: Enhance accessibility by including essential contact information such as your business email and phone number (if comfortable sharing publicly). Additionally, integrate your online calendar into your Gravatar profile, simplifying the process for contacts to schedule follow-up meetings and engagements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Privacy controls</strong>: Gravatar empowers users with privacy controls, allowing selective sharing of personal information. You can publicly display only the contact details you&#8217;re comfortable sharing, maintaining control over your privacy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it even easier to share your contact details, you can add a QR code that connects to your Gravatar profile on your conference tag or business card. By doing this, you can make it more visible and accessible for potential connections. Check out <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/profiles/qr-codes/#:~:text=QR%20Codes%20are%202%2Ddimensional,page%20for%20the%20requested%20profile\">Gravatar’s step-by-step instructions</a> on creating QR codes for details!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Follow up with your connections</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking is an ongoing process. Cultivating relationships requires follow-ups to solidify connections and create meaningful engagement. Here&#8217;s how you can effectively follow up with your connections:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Encouraging follow-ups with Gravatar</strong>: Include your email, phone number, online calendar, and contact form to increase the chances of people contacting you. Gravatar makes it easy for others to contact you and promotes proactive communication.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CRM systems</strong>: Use Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to track new connections and manage interactions smoothly. Integrating with email tools allows you to send automated messages and set reminders for follow-up tasks to ensure no missed connections.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Template messages</strong>: Prepare message templates in advance that can be personalized for each new connection. This improves the follow-up process while maintaining a personalized touch that resonates with recipients.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Workflow automation</strong>: Implement workflow automation to trigger a series of actions post-conference. Set up sequences for LinkedIn connection requests, thank-you emails, and reminder tasks for future follow-ups. This ensures consistent engagement and maximizes the potential of your networking efforts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Transform connections into career milestones with Gravatar</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With these tips, you&#8217;re ready for any networking event or conference. To be even more prepared, create your Gravatar profile. Maintaining a consistent Gravatar across platforms improves your personal branding, ensuring you&#8217;re recognized and respected in your field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By linking a QR code to your Gravatar profile on your business card or digital conference tag, you can quickly transfer your contact information to new connections, and by adding your contact details, including your calendar link, to your Gravatar profile, it’s easy for new contacts to follow up with you!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is the perfect companion tool for making new connections and nurturing existing ones. <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Build your own Gravatar profile today</a> and start networking like a pro!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 16 Jun 2024 19:37:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Ronnie Burt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WordPress.org blog: Highlights from WordCamp Europe 2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17374\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/06/highlights-from-wordcamp-europe-2024/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8325:\"<p><em>2,584 attendees participated in the 12th annual WordPress event in Europe, held at the </em><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/venue/\"><em>Lingotto Conference and Exhibition Centre</em></a><em> in Torino, Italy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/06/wceu-torino-night.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17376\" />The <a href=\"https://www.museocinema.it/en/museum-and-ma-prolo-foundation/mole-antonelliana\">Mole Antonelliana</a> in Torino, illuminated to celebrate WordCamp Europe 2024\n\n\n\n<p>From June 13-15, 2024, WordPress enthusiasts from across the globe gathered in Torino to explore and celebrate the world’s most popular web platform.

Yesterday, we talked about our official launch and gave you an overview. There was quite a bit more to cover, but one of the things I promised to do is talk about our shows, what&#8217;s behind them, and the great hosts we have serving them out. Also, I mentioned that it was obvious with the various topics and focuses on certain shows that they needed to be broken out. To top that off, we brought with the launch the ability to subscribe to the shows you want to listen to—whether as few as you want, as many as you want, or the entire channel feed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More important than the names of the shows and what they bring are our hosts. Way back when I started Do the Woo, after fewer than a handful of guests, Brad Williams joined as a co-host. Later on, we added a few more, and it just kept growing. I see a lot of talent and passion out there in our ecosystem, and often the shows were created around the hosts. Luckily for me, they were just a perfect fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no logic that I could ever put down on paper that would guide you or anyone else through this process if you were trying to choose the number of hosts I have. Sometimes it&#8217;s a gut feeling; maybe it&#8217;s about the person themselves, the show, or a relationship I&#8217;ve had with them already as a colleague or a friend. Whatever the case, it has always worked out. Some hosts have come and gone, and they reside in our hall of fame and know they&#8217;re always welcome to come back. I&#8217;ve worked hard to bring a diverse group of voices, personalities, and backgrounds. Let&#8217;s just say not everyone wants to be a podcast host. I&#8217;ve asked a lot of people, and I&#8217;ve gotten more no&#8217;s than yes&#8217;s, obviously. Hey, I get it. It&#8217;s just not everyone&#8217;s thing. So, I keep working at this, but I also have the benefit of bringing in a lot of diversity through guests and guest hosts who do one-off episodes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I really want to get on track here. Let&#8217;s get into the shows—all 12 of them. Each one was started because I saw the importance of the content that surfaced. The best way to do this is to give you a look at each one of these shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we have All Things WordPress and WooCommerce. Obviously, it sounds like a catchall bucket, and initially, it was and kind of still is because I took all the past shows and rebranded them to have a consistent new look. This was one of those shows that just didn&#8217;t quite fit into the others. I could pop it in there, which still holds true in the cases of guests and guest hosts who do one-off shows. But as you can tell now, it has transitioned into three specialty areas that really needed to be part of the Do the Woo channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first, we have Emerging Tech with Dave from Automattic. Dave is very avid and lives and breathes all things emerging in the tech industry, especially things like AI, crypto, and blockchain. Of course, there&#8217;s a lot more. We have had some other hosts on this show, but Dave is kind of carrying it right now. It&#8217;s really about taking these emerging technologies and looking at those topics and how they are becoming part of, or will be a part of, the WordPress and Woo ecosystem. So, if you want to stay on the very cliché-sounding cutting edge of things to come, that&#8217;s what Dave will be doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have Anne and Taeke, who just recently started a series with a focus on accessibility. This was something I wanted to get in on a more regular basis because it is an important topic that needs to be talked about. I was thrilled when Anne offered to be a host. Now, the funny side of this story is Taeke was supposed to be her first guest on the show, and as we were chatting before we started recording, I saw a connection between them. Now maybe this is a warning: you never know what&#8217;s going to happen when I&#8217;m around. The next thing I know, I&#8217;m inviting Taeke to be a regular host with Anne. By the time we started recording, well, he was a co-host. So you can see how these things kind of happen here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, under All Things WordPress and WooCommerce, Sophia and Allison have just started a series called The Next Gen. These two are perfect examples of the next generation of WordPressers, and they&#8217;re going to be bringing on other younger guests to figure this whole thing out on how we get WordPress ready for the next generation. Well, I&#8217;m really not, but there&#8217;s not much pressure on them. Seriously, this is something that has seen a lot of discussion around it, and I know we are going to learn a lot, not just from these two, but from the guests they bring in. This is something we really need to pay attention to, and I&#8217;m thrilled to have them doing this show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, now I just explained one show. Maybe I should go through these a little quicker because I know your time is limited. Next, we have Community Voices: WordPress Around the World. This evolved because every time I get a guest or host on where English is their second language, which is a lot of guests we have on here, I&#8217;m constantly amazed by how well they do. But you know, you still see there&#8217;s times when you&#8217;re just missing a little bit of their enthusiasm, their story, their passion, and the process. So, I started thinking, well, what could we do and put in place to invite regional WordPress communities to come in and talk about their local WordPress community? Most importantly, they would be talking about their community to their community, making sure they understand what they&#8217;re saying. This podcast was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one we invited was the Serbian community. Then we had one put together by the Spanish community, which was ironic because it was ad hoc at WordCamp US. Then we enjoyed the Dutch WordPress community, followed by my new home country of Portugal. It&#8217;s going to be really interesting to see how this evolves, and I&#8217;m sure it might evolve into more than just talks about the community. We&#8217;ll see. It has started out a little bit slow, but I&#8217;m anxious to get this one up to speed. I know we&#8217;re all anxious to see those communities come on and talk to their own community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we have Inside Woo. In some past episodes, we were always talking with somebody directly from WooCommerce.com. They fit perfectly into this, and then we started thinking more about it. Well, let&#8217;s keep it there for those special shows. In fact, recently, CEO Paul from Woo and a few others joined in on a conversation with one of their customers, and that was really interesting to hear a CEO talk with one of their customers. These are the kind of conversations moving forward. Let&#8217;s just say this: there will always be somebody on Inside Woo from WooCommerce.com. They&#8217;ll either be a guest or maybe a guest host. It just gives you a deeper look into Woo, maybe a peek behind the curtains or just whipping them wide open one way or another. So for now, let&#8217;s just say you never know what you will hear or who you will hear from on Inside Woo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open Talk on Open Source. Robert and Courtney are doing this newer show twice a month that just recently started. Yes, they&#8217;re talking more about the other open-source projects out there, introducing them to you, and keeping you up to date on the bigger picture. The idea came to me through a few conversations—actually, quite a few—and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;d been thinking about myself. It just felt important. I think that WordPress people should be exposed to and understand things outside the WordPress bubble as far as all these open-source projects. I really believe this will help you if you listen to this in your business with your clients. Also, it will help you understand just how many open-source projects integrate with each other, how they integrate with WooCommerce, and how they integrate with WordPress as a whole. Robert and Courtney both have massive experience in the bigger open-source ecosystem, so they are perfect hosts for this show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s The WordPress Way. Boy, does that sound familiar, huh? I could say a lot about this and the title alone. To me personally, I now envision the WordPress way as something we are doing now and what we&#8217;re doing moving forward. In fact, I did another short podcast just talking about those three words. To me, the WordPress way is what WordPress is all about and what&#8217;s important to the community and the health of it. There will be a variety of topics under this one. Abha has been doing this for some time, and it easily fit into this show. She has a great history of talking with contributors around the world and sharing incredible stories. She loves doing this. You can tell by every show, and who knows where she&#8217;ll go with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit, who is one of our newer hosts, drills in or really focuses on DEIB—diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. She leads a working group at Make WordPress and has a passion that comes through as she moves into this new series. So check that out. There are going to be a lot of interesting conversations on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we really haven&#8217;t done this yet, but Courtney will also be doing some shows in this off and on. We just haven&#8217;t quite gotten our stuff together yet. She&#8217;s on top of everything WordPress core—I mean, Courtney knows stuff. Courtney&#8217;s in our open-source talk. Courtney just is WordPress, and now and then she&#8217;ll drop in and pull together other great conversations, probably a lot around Core, Make.WordPress, and all those things in between. So keep an eye out on that show. There&#8217;ll be some other stuff that falls into the way that, well, isn&#8217;t maybe one of these three hosts that fit so well because it is basically, to put it bluntly, the WordPress way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Agency Chat. We have two episodes that are very different from each other each month. The first one is hosted by Robbie and Robert, who will jump in with a founder, a team member, or other industry experts. They share what it takes to build and grow a successful agency business in the Woo space. There have already been so many good conversations on this one, and I know that everybody walks away having learned something, whether you are thinking of evolving into an agency or you&#8217;re currently an agency. Robert and Robbie both have tons of agency experience themselves and bring a lot to this show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then on the flip side of that, we invite two agency owners to guest host and have a conversation. They basically take over the show. Topics range from building a team to insightful strategies and even sometimes what&#8217;s in their stack. It goes in a lot of different directions, and the conversations are casual, but those casual conversations generally bring out some incredible tips, insights, and yes, stories as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have Woo BizChat, three episodes a month hosted by Adam, Emma, Katie, and Marcus. These four bring a really diverse background and experience to these conversations. Sometimes they have them between themselves, and sometimes they have them with guests. As you can imagine by the title, it&#8217;s all about running and helping you build and grow your successful Woo business. The key here is even though it&#8217;s called Woo BizChat, it&#8217;s really broader than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From having listened to a lot of the shows, and I know from people who have given us feedback, any WordPress business will pick up something from this show. What a lot of this revolves around as far as guests is business owners themselves or other experts bringing in advice and tips. You can be assured you&#8217;ll discover nuggets of knowledge—not only new stuff that you will learn but also many experiences that you can relate to and may help you, or you may simply be able to empathize with it. So, quite a variety of topics coming in Woo BizChat for the future. We have a good backlog already, so check that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we move into Woo Product Chat with current hosts Tammy and Jonathan. These two are tops when it comes to businesses and products. They know their stuff. Jonathan has been on for quite some time, and the chats between themselves and others have a really unique way and talent of pulling out the best from their own internal thoughts and from product builders. Like our other shows, these product builders give you insights whether you&#8217;re a builder yourself, you&#8217;ve done it for a year, maybe you&#8217;ve done it for ten years, or you&#8217;re thinking of moving into products from services or adding products. A lot of the stories have been about transition, for sure. In fact, that&#8217;s a theme you hear a lot—a lot of agencies, builders, and freelancers that are doing sites move into the product side of stuff. It&#8217;s a constant theme through a lot of these different shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have another host coming in for a second episode for Woo Product Chat real soon, and it&#8217;s going to be a good one. Okay, I&#8217;ll tell you who it is: James Kemp from Woo. I&#8217;m going to leave you with that and have you anticipating. More on that real soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we cannot go without mentioning Woo DevChat. What would any Do the Woo be without a Woo DevChat? Seriously, Zach and Carl have been doing this show for some time, and if I could explain it to you in a nutshell, I would. But there is possibly no way. But seriously, this is where we get down and geeky by bringing in a guest or two. You never know where the conversation will go with this. I will say, if you are a developer, you&#8217;re going to like this one. And even if you&#8217;re not a Woo developer, you can learn a lot. Imagine sitting down with two other developers and talking shop for an hour. That&#8217;s what this show is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As amazing as you may think, some developers are very much introverts, and when they get talking with each other, the tables turn. Nudging right up close to this launch, we have another pair of hosts who have come on for Woo DevChat. Marcel and Mike have joined as co-hosts for a second episode each month. To explain that better, I&#8217;m going to suggest that you listen to the latest Woo DevChat with all four of them where they geek out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking about Zach, Carl, Marcel, and Mike. What&#8217;s great is they get into their geekiness during that show, but you also get to learn what Mike and Marcel will be bringing to the show as well. So please go and check that out. You can always find it under Woo DevChat on the site. If you&#8217;re subscribed, you&#8217;ll see it. It&#8217;s called &#8220;For a Good Time: 4 Developers, 4 Hosts.&#8221; Like I said, if you&#8217;re a dev, I promise you&#8217;ll love this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Event Talk is as straightforward as you can get. It&#8217;s all about events in our space—WordCamps, meetups, next-gen events, all that good stuff. Most have been conversations with various hosts, guests, and guest hosts. Some have actually been done at WordCamps, while others are collections of voices throughout the community talking about events. Recently, we added a regular host to this podcast. Devin, a full-time sponsored community team contributor at WordPress.org, is hosting at least one episode a month. Sometimes she&#8217;s done more, but she&#8217;ll be there one time a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cool thing about Devin is she loves community, she loves events, and she loves innovation. She is on top of everything, and there&#8217;s no end to what we can expect from the shows that she will be hosting. So if you are really into WordPress events, you want to hear more about them, especially if you&#8217;re new to this space, this is a great one to listen to because you hear a lot about what drives this community—even some of the challenges, the wins, and everything in between from people who are putting these together. I would highly recommend checking this one out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I hope you&#8217;re still with me here. I&#8217;ve been talking for a while now. There&#8217;s only so much Bob you want to listen to, but I&#8217;m getting close here, so hang in there just a little bit more. We&#8217;re down to two more, and I&#8217;m going to keep these brief for obvious reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the launch, we started the newest and what I&#8217;m hoping, praying, is our last show to round us out at an even 12. That is Scaling Enterprise WordPress and OSS. If you don&#8217;t understand the acronym OSS, it&#8217;s Open Source Software. This one&#8217;s been in the works for some time. We&#8217;ve been planning it, and now we have this unique partnership with Scale Consortium, which you can learn about in this show I&#8217;m going to tell you about here real soon. We have three hosts: Brad, who is returning after a Do the Woo hiatus, with Karim and Tom. This show is going to be so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the future of WordPress Enterprise. It&#8217;s been part of it, but now we&#8217;re really talking about it. To get a good feel for this one, I think you should check out their intro show that also debuted during this launch week. Let&#8217;s just say you&#8217;re not only going to learn about enterprise if you&#8217;re interested in it, if you want to understand what it is, or if you&#8217;re thinking of how to take your agency to the enterprise level, but you&#8217;re also going to be exposed to the bigger picture of enterprise and open source, which is an incredible value that you may not always get within the bubble of WordPress. I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better lineup for the hosts than these three. So do check that show out; it just happened a few days ago, and you can learn more about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last but not least, WooBits. Anyway, WooBits—if you&#8217;ve been around, you&#8217;ve seen WooBits, you heard WooBits. If you haven&#8217;t been around, you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about. In either case, it&#8217;s changing. I will tell you more about that. Plus, if you&#8217;re not aware of it, we do have a news channel as well, somewhere where we keep up on Do the Woo news, not news in general. I talked about how we don&#8217;t do that stuff. This is more about what&#8217;s happening here at Do the Woo. If you want to keep up on what changes we&#8217;re making, you can subscribe to that. Or, as I said, it will come with the full channel feed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s leave it at that. I&#8217;m getting tired; you&#8217;re probably getting tired of listening to me. But I just wanted to have the opportunity to tell you about these shows. Since we&#8217;ve done this, there are so many more things I could tell you. I could even tell you how I branded all these shows, which is another whole show in itself. But I really felt like I wanted to tell you everything that is here because sometimes you just don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to thank our sponsors once again: Airwallex, Avalara, Cloudways, GoDaddy, Hostinger, Omnisend, and Weglot. Please go to their sites and check them out. Depending on the show you listen to, you&#8217;ll hear more about them. We have links to them on our site. They are what make Do the Woo possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a company or you know of a company that might be interested in sponsoring, we still have some spots left. Just go to dothewoo.io/sponsor and let&#8217;s chat. In the end, subscribe to your favorite show or shows, or all shows—your choice. As I said earlier, you can also consider supporting not only your favorite show but your favorite hosts. If you are interested in being a guest or a guest host on any of these shows, you can head over to dothewoo.io and find the link in the footer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So again, I will close it out. Cheers. And feel free to ping me. You can find me just</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>As we get towards the end of our Do the Woo 4.0 launch week, it only seemed right to dive into all the shows we now have. A bit of background on each, one, who the hosts are and why we moved into a channel podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see a <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/our-shows/\">full list of all of our shows here</a></strong> and discover the dedicated page to each show.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 15 Jun 2024 08:10:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"Do The Woo Community: Do the Woo Podcast Channel 4.0 Official Launch\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=84105\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://dothewoo.io/do-the-woo-podcast-channel-4-0-official-launch/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8122:\"Episode Transcript\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Hey, BobWP here, and welcome to the launch of Do the Woo 4.0!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day is here—the first official day of the event at WordCamp Europe and the official launch of our site. To be honest, I don’t even know where to begin. Since its return in 2018, the podcast has undergone many different phases of growth. So let&#8217;s step back to the end of 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we moved Do the Woo to its own site, it was the first major step. As I grew the format over time and found new hosts to join our team, something struck me around the end of 2022. Some call it a tickle, that little feeling that there is something bigger on the horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving into 2023, I revisited the reason for creating Do the Woo: building a community of builders and business owners in the space. But as time went on, my ideas grew beyond just WooCommerce to encompass the bigger picture of WordPress. Naturally, one thing led to another, and I spent many early mornings waking up with new ideas that kept me from falling back to sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew in my heart that everything revolved around two simple concepts: elevating voices and creating a podcast by the community, for the community. The rest would all fall into place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to October of last year. I had been creating more episodes, each fitting into its niche yet still part of the Do the Woo firehose. It was one big pond with so many fish. But seriously, for months I dreamt of a new site—a site that would showcase the Do the Woo podcast channels, where people could find and subscribe to the shows they wanted. At the same time, I didn’t want to tinker with my site anymore. I just wanted to create content. Longingly, I looked at the opportunity of moving to WordPress.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my head, it all sounded great, but I knew what it would take in terms of resources. I sent a Slack message to Matt Mullenweg and told him what I was thinking about. Two or three weeks later, I had a team to redesign my site, I became a new partner with WordPress.com, and the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, there’s a lot to unpack in those last few sentences that I will save for another time. But I have never been more thrilled about the future of Do the Woo than at that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rest assured, I am not part of Automattic, nor did anyone get a piece of me. We are still who we are. The fact that Do the Woo was valued as much as it is speaks volumes about everyone who has helped me build this community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait a minute. I’m here to tell you about the launch. The process between then and now has been incredible. I will have some of the team join me on the podcast to talk about it more later. I’m sure there are other bits and pieces I will add along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of you may have seen the site go live in March. WordPress.com pushed out a cool video they made of me (I never in my life thought the words &#8220;cool,&#8221; &#8220;video,&#8221; and &#8220;me&#8221; would be in the same sentence). It was done in Madrid before State of the Word 2023. But let’s just say it was still a diamond in the rough behind the scenes. So, we decided not to call it our official launch and worked some more on it—both the site and the content. Again, the story behind that will be saved for another podcast, somewhere, sometime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I will do is give you a quick overview of what you will now find at DotheWoo.io, aside from the fact that the site was built by some of the best WordPressers in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We now have all of our shows in place as of this launch, with the Enterprise one you heard about earlier this week being our latest addition, capping the number of shows at an even dozen. Any new episodes will always fall under the existing shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each show has its own page where you can not only learn about it and see past episodes but also subscribe to your favorite shows. This was one of the top priorities of the new site: to give listeners an easy way to subscribe to the content they wanted. Of course, you can always subscribe to all the shows via the Do the Woo full feed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the About page, you will find all the amazing hosts—all 25 of them, sans myself. In fact, between the shows and the hosts, there is so much more to say. So tomorrow, watch for an episode telling you more of the story behind the shows and the hosts, I promise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on the About page, we have a very cool map that shows where all our hosts, sponsors, and guests have come from around the world. I know there are quite a few places we need to fill up, but hey, we are only on version 4.0. You can click on a guest and see the shows they have been part of. With 459 of them, many have done multiple shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are so many other things I could talk about, but I think at this point, I would just ask that if you have not been to dothewoo.io for some time—and I know a lot of you listen to shows via a podcast app—take a few minutes and click through. I would love to hear your feedback on the post of this episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I go, two more very important things I would like to mention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you will now see a support option on our site. This is a bit different, as anyone can have the opportunity to support a specific show and its hosts, who volunteer their time here. Please check that out, and I’ll be talking about it more later on. But I do thank all the companies and, of course, the hosts whose links are listed there as well for stepping up and doing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A special thanks to our partners: WordPress.com, WooCommerce, and Jetpack. Your belief in our community and the support you have given is more than I could have ever dreamed of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, our sponsors. We have had a lot of them bring us to where we are today, and I wish I could list them all from day one. But I know your time is valuable, so I would like to give a huge shoutout to our current sponsors: Airwallex, Avalara, Cloudways, GoDaddy, Hostinger, Omnisend, and Weglot. Do the Woo would not be what it is or even exist if not for these sponsors. So please, at any opportunity, thank them and consider their products or services for your next build. They have stepped into a community that they truly believe in and are supporting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, let’s call that a wrap, huh? I am always open if you have other questions about our launch, are interested in being on the podcast, or perhaps want to support or sponsor a show. You know where to find me. But I can tell you this: we have so much more to do and some really cool stuff coming down the road. So stay tuned, and I just want to thank you, our listeners, for your amazing support. Until next time.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The official launch of Do the Woo 4.0 is today, coinciding with the first day of WordCamp Europe. Since its return in 2018, it has undergone significant growth and changes, culminating in the creation of a new, dedicated website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal has always been  to build a community of builders and business owners, focusing on both WooCommerce and the broader WordPress ecosystem. BobWP tells you more about the redesigned site and how it aims to make content creation easier and more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our new site features all podcast shows in one place, making it easier for listeners to find and subscribe to their favorite shows.

This major update is a big milestone for us, and we’re diving deep into all things Do the Woo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the launch is front and center in my mind, Contributor Day always brings me back to the core of our mission: amplifying the voices of the incredible doers in the wider WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, you’ll likely find me at the community team area, possibly at the DEIB table, or maybe wandering around. Contributor Day is a powerful reminder of why we do what we do at Do the Woo. Seeing all these amazing people having conversations and working on their laptops never gets old. I admire and applaud their contributions to our ecosystem and the open-source community. This sight has been a constant source of inspiration for me since I first attended Contributor Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many of our shows, especially in the WordPress Way and WordPress Event Talk series, we’ve highlighted numerous contributors. Their dedication to the project often comes up, underscoring the importance of community. If you ever get the chance to attend a Contributor Day, I highly encourage you to do so. Reflect on the power of community, and the incredible impact it has on our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s always more to be done to ensure the sustainability of the project. Many of these discussions have taken place on our shows, and I’m proud to have been a part of them. Each day, as I listen to my fantastic hosts talk with community members and hear their stories, it warms my heart and soul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yes, in a way, Contributor Day is part of our launch. It’s the part that keeps me and my incredible team of hosts motivated. On this particular Contributor Day, likely one of the largest ever, I’m proud to be part of this community and behind a podcast that is for the community and by the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it. Cheers!</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>As we continue near the Do the Woo 4.0 launch, today is Contributor Day at WordCamp Europe, and while we anticipate tomorrow&#8217;s official launch, I’m immersed in the community that defines our mission. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether I’m at the DEIB table or mingling with other contributors, this day is the reason why we amplify the voices of the incredible doers in the WordPress space. Reflecting on their dedication and the power of our community, I&#8217;m reminded of the heart and soul behind Do the Woo, driving us to keep doing what we do.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Jun 2024 07:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Do The Woo Community: A Pre-Launch Chat with Jay Walsh at WooCommerce\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=84147\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://dothewoo.io/a-pre-launch-chat-with-jay-walsh-at-woocommerce/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7310:\"Episode Transcript\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>BobWP:<br />Hey, how are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jay:<br />Very excited to see things getting ready for the big launch of Do the Woo 4.0 hosted on WordPress.com. We&#8217;re thrilled to see things unfold and to witness the new site launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Tomorrow is the day when things start rolling out. We did the soft launch when I was at Cloudfest in Germany, and that was when the new site was moved over to WordPress.com. Since then, we&#8217;ve been cleaning things up, working to make it nice, shiny, and bright, to really help people dig into it and understand what&#8217;s going on inside the podcast. A lot of people don&#8217;t even visit the site; it&#8217;s more than just an app. We’ve added many features to make it more community-oriented, and it&#8217;s good stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jay:<br />For those of us at Woo, we see Do the Woo as more than just a podcast. It makes so much sense to us to see it unfold as a space filled with knowledge and information from so many folks we&#8217;ve talked to. It&#8217;s easy to underestimate how much content is there, how many interviews you&#8217;ve done, and how many incredible people have contributed over time. It&#8217;s amazing to see you taking advantage of the latest advances in WordPress and how WordPress.com integrates these features. It’s more than just blocks; there are so many other features. Often, we refer people to specific episodes of Do the Woo where they can find the full transcript and other related content. This platform will be powerful not just for us but for anyone new to the community or those moving into more focused work with clients. It&#8217;s an incredibly rich resource. You are truly running one of the greatest collections of information, resources, and conversations about Woo on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Thank you. It&#8217;s been such a long process. I had the vision of breaking it up into shows early last year. I ruminated on it, talked to people, and everything builds on Woo. We&#8217;ve been able to explore spaces that might not be Woo-specific but are still very important. We&#8217;re launching a new show soon, and another on open source to help WordPress developers understand other projects and how they interrelate. This journey has been incredible, and it&#8217;s probably the most fun I&#8217;ve had with podcasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jay:<br />It takes podcasting to a much bigger space. It&#8217;s more than just listening to something; it&#8217;s a place where the community can come together. The site is like the bedrock, a place where people can see that it&#8217;s more than just the latest episode. It has a lot of material that goes way back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Absolutely. We have a wide range of guests, many of whom had never been on a podcast before. My vision was to make it a comfortable place for first-timers. It’s amazing to see how one experience can inspire people to do more, like speaking at meetups or WordCamps. That first experience can push them to be brave and start talking to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jay:<br />You&#8217;ve created a welcoming space for those voices. Do the Woo has been the first platform for many at Woo and Automatic to participate in a one-to-many situation. It&#8217;s not just about recording; it&#8217;s about launching conversations that people can promote and share. The platform is egoless, focusing on getting everyone involved, from merchants to developers. Your curiosity about hearing people’s stories is evident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />I’ve always wanted to amplify voices, and this platform allows me to do that. It’s wonderful to see people connect, build friendships, and form partnerships from being on the show together. The variety of experiences shared is what makes it exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jay:<br />That variety is evident to anyone who listens. For Do the Woo 4.0, I’m excited about your commitment to expanding the community’s voices beyond the conventional western perspective. Including localized content and non-English languages is brave and powerful. It&#8217;s amazing to see Woo being used globally, and the new platform will help highlight that diversity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />One of my big goals was to be more global. At WordCamp Asia, I met people from different parts of Asia who listen to the show. It was eye-opening and confirmed that we’re on the right path. There’s a lot of room to grow, and we’ll continue to share this journey. With partners like Woo, Jetpack, and WordPress.com, along with our sponsors, we have the support needed to keep going. It’s humbling to have their trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jay:<br />You&#8217;ve always maintained a positive outlook, which is refreshing. The podcast is about good conversation and highlighting the positive things people are doing. It’s been a place for civil, curious, and learning-focused discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />That’s the essence of the podcast. We’re here to talk about the good stuff people are doing. It’s amazing to see the impact of the conversations we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jay:<br />For the launch of Do the Woo 4.0, we’re thrilled to see the new home and how you’ll take advantage of all the amazing features. It’s an exciting moment, and we’re proud to support you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Thank you. There are many exciting ideas in the pipeline. The new site’s workflow is smooth, and the smart people behind it have done an incredible job. It’s great to see everything come together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jay:<br />I love that you take us behind the scenes and show us how it’s made. It’s valuable for those of us in WordPress and WooCommerce to see the process. You’re pushing the envelope and setting a high standard, which benefits everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />For sure. I’ll be at WordCamp Europe, participating in various events and at our table in the small business area. We’re not just doing podcasts but co-hosting the table with some fun people. I look forward to meeting everyone, and Jay, you’ll be missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jay:<br />I’ll be there in spirit. It’s going to be a great time, and the Do the Woo table will be the place to be. Have a great time and good luck with the launch. We’re all excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Thank you, and thank you for putting this chat together before we dive into WordCamp Europe. Everyone, we’ll see you soon. Thank you, Jay.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong>Inside Woo</strong>, <strong>BobWP</strong> and <strong>Jay Walsh from WooCommerce</strong> dive into the upcoming launch of Do the Woo 4.0 hosted on WordPress.com.

I love writing and do it regularly in three languages: English, Swedish, and Russian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professionally, I’ve gained lot of experience over the last 30 years as Project Manager, Product Manager, and Change Manager, mainly in Telecom and IT. During this time, I have lived and worked in ten countries. I’ve been leading small and large teams, working both on-site and remotely, in positions with both system vendors and operator companies (startups, as well as large, mature companies). I’ve been doing both traditional “waterfall” projects, and leading Scrum teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In parallel, between projects, I’ve also worked many years as a professional linguist (English, Swedish, and Russian).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Discovering WordPress</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started blogging in Russian on a different platform in early 2005. A couple of years later I picked up writing poetry and short form fiction in Swedish, publishing it initially on a specialized Swedish resource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, I decided to gather most of my writing in one place. I got me a domain, installed WordPress and built my own three-language web site. I still remember how magically easy it was to migrate my Russian blog from LiveJournal to WordPress already in 2011.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Initial contribution to the WordPress eco-system</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For use on my own sites, I improved the Swedish and Russian translations of the theme I was using and shared these translations with the theme developer for other people to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Contributing more actively</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using WordPress was fun. Now and then I help friends and family setting up simple sites. I was gradually becoming more interested in participating in the making of WordPress as a way of giving back to the community. I happened to have some spare time available when WordPress 4.7 was being prepared. Being a professional translator, I quickly suggested several hundreds of strings for the Swedish translation and was quickly promoted to General Translation Editor for Swedish. Soon I was expanding and mentoring the Swedish translation team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>But there was more to it</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an experienced Project Manager and Change Manager, I strived to understand the fuller picture better, and helped fellow GTEs for other language teams to discuss and solve problems they encountered. Here, too, I was soon promoted to team representative and global mentor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, I’ve been contributing in several ways: co-organizer of a WordCamp in Stockholm, co-organizer of several translation events, Support contributor (especially in the Swedish support forum), as speaker, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I’ve participated actively in discussions around improving “discoverability” of contributing to WordPress and creating smoother on-boarding for new contributors. I also participated as mentor in the pilot cohorts of our new mentoring program for new contributors. This kind of building structure and improving processes come naturally to me, because of my professional experience and my interests in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want the WordPress community to become even stronger and more sustainable. There’s much more to be done, especially when it comes to building up strong local communities that can translate, train, popularize and support WordPress in many different languages and locations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d be enormously happy to contribute much more to these processes. A perfect solution would be to become a full-time sponsored contributor, where I’d be fully able to bring big value. It may go the other way, too: If I get hired for some intensive project, I may not have time and energy for WordPress, even if contributing here brings me happiness and fulfillment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tor-Björn (Tobi) Fjellner</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id6848_4286a0-c6 alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top kb-theme-content-width\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column6848_c4c0da-d7\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<p><strong>You can start contributing to WordPress today:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more than 20 volunteer teams contributing to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, there are teams that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>translate WordPress to more than 60 language versions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>develop and maintain documentation (in several languages)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>create trainings and self-study material (in several languages)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>edit, subtitle, and publish video recordings of presentations</li>\n\n\n\n<li>organize meetups and WordPress conferences</li>\n\n\n\n<li>gather photos and other media files that are free to use on any site</li>\n\n\n\n<li>… and much more</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/\">https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/</a> to find which team suits you the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>See a list of the main teams at <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">https://make.wordpress.org/</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Register your personal forum account at <a href=\"https://login.wordpress.org/register?locale=en_US\">https://login.wordpress.org/register?locale=en_US</a>&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search a WordPress event near you at <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/\">https://events.wordpress.org/</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<p class=\"kt-adv-heading6848_c1e170-ec wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Welcome!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"svenska\" class=\"kt-adv-heading6848_83d9c3-1c wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Att tillföra stort värde till WordPress utan programmering</h1>\n\n\n\nHär läser Tobi själv sin berättelse på svenska.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Man kan bidra till WordPress på många sätt, och långt ifrån alla kräver kunskaper i programmering. Här vill jag berätta om hur jag hittade fram till WordPress och vad projektet betyder för mig personligen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Vem är jag?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag är från Sverige men bor utomlands sedan 23 år. Jag gillar teknik i allmänhet, framför allt IT och telekom. Jag älskar att skriva och gör det regelbundet på tre olika språk: engelska, svenska och ryska.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Genom mina jobb har jag samlat på mig stor erfarenhet under de senaste 30 åren som projektledare, produktchef och change manager, främst inom telekom och IT. Sammanlagt har jag bott och arbetat i tio länder. Jag har lett både små och stora team, arbetat direkt på plats och på distans, för både systemleverantörer och telekomoperatörer (både nystartade och etablerade operatörer). Jag har både arbetat med traditionellt projektformat och lett Scrum-team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mellan projekten, har jag också arbetat många år som professionell översättare och redaktör (på engelska, svenska och ryska).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hur jag upptäckte WordPress</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag började blogga på ryska på en annan plattform i början av 2005. Ett par år senare började jag skriva poesi och korta skönlitterära texter på svenska, som jag i början publicerade på en specialiserad webbplats (poeter.se).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>År 2011 bestämde jag mig för att samla det mesta av mitt skrivande på en plats. Jag skaffade en domän, installerade WordPress och byggde min egen trespråkiga webbplats. Jag minns fortfarande hur magiskt enkelt det var att migrera min ryska blogg från LiveJournal till WordPress redan år 2011.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mitt första bidrag till WordPress ekosystem</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag förbättrade de svenska och ryska översättningarna av temat jag använde för eget bruk och skickade dem även till temats utvecklare så att andra kunde ha nytta av dem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bidrar mer aktivt</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Det var roligt att använda WordPress. Ibland hjälpte jag familj och vänner att skapa enkla webbplatser. Efterhand började jag intressera mig mer för att bidra till WordPress som ett sätt att ge tillbaka till communityn. Jag råkade ha tid över när WordPress 4.7 var på väg att lanseras. Med min erfarenhet som professionell översättare föreslog jag svenska översättningar för hundratals strängar och blev snabbt befordrad till svensk översättningsredaktör för WordPress (General Translation Editor). Kort därefter var jag sysselsatt med att hitta fler översättare och fungera som mentor för det svenska översättningsteamet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mer än så</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Som erfaren projektledare och förändringsledare strävade jag efter att förstå helhetsbilden bättre och hjälpte även GTE:er med råd och stöd om de undrade över något. Även här blev jag snart befordrad till teamrepresentant och global mentor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sedan dess har jag bidragit på flera sätt: jag var med och organiserade en WordCamp-konferens i Stockholm, medorganisatör av flera översättningsevenemang, aktiv i supportforumen (särskilt det svenska supportforumet), talare på konferenser, med mera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>På senare tid deltar jag aktivt i diskussioner kring hur vi kan göra det enklare att ”upptäcka” möjligheter att bidra till WordPress och göra processen smidigare för nya volontärer. Jag deltog också som mentor i pilotomgångarna av vårt nya mentorprogram för nya bidragsgivare. Att strukturera verksamhet och förbättra processer är naturligt för mig, som en följd av min yrkeserfarenhet och intressen i allmänhet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Min önskan är att WordPress-communityn ska bli ännu starkare och tåligare. Det går att göra mycket mer, i synnerhet när det gäller att bygga upp starka lokala communities som kan översätta, skapa utbildning, popularisera och stödja WordPress på många olika språk runt om i världen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag vore enormt glad om jag får möjlighet att bidra mycket mer till dessa processer. En perfekt lösning skulle vara att bli en WordPress-volontär på heltid med sponsring från något företag i branschen. Jag kommer att kunna tillföra stort värde. Det kan gå åt andra hållet också: Om jag får anställning med något intensivt och krävande projekt utanför WordPress kanske jag inte kommer att hinna eller orka att bidra till WordPress, trots att det ger mig glädje och tillfredsställelse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tor-Björn (Tobi) Fjellner</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id6848_182f9a-32 alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top kb-theme-content-width\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column6848_e5a438-c6\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<p>Du kan börja bidra till WordPress idag:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Det finns över 20 volontärteam som bidrar till WordPress på olika sätt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Till exempel finns det team som:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>översätter WordPress till fler än 60 språkversioner</li>\n\n\n\n<li>utvecklar och underhåller dokumentation (på flera språk)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>skapar utbildningar och självstudiematerial (på flera språk)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>redigerar, undertexter och publicerar videoinspelningar av presentationer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>organiserar träffar och WordPress-konferenser</li>\n\n\n\n<li>samlar foton och andra mediafiler som är fria att använda på vilken webbplats som helst</li>\n\n\n\n<li>och mycket mer</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Gå till https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/ för att hitta vilket team som passar dig bäst.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Du kan också:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Se en lista över de viktigaste teamen på <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">https://make.wordpress.org/</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Registrera ditt personliga forumkonto på <a href=\"https://login.wordpress.org/register?locale=sv_SE\">https://login.wordpress.org/register?locale=sv_SE</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Söka efter ett WordPress-evenemang nära dig via https://events.wordpress.org/</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<p class=\"kt-adv-heading6848_5a4fda-7d wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Välkommen!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"russian\" class=\"kt-adv-heading6848_f180c3-95 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Как быть полезным для WordPress если ты не программист</strong></h1>\n\n\n\nТут Тоби сам читает свой рассказ.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Есть ряд способов внести свой вклад в WordPress, и многие из них не требуют навыков программирования. Хочу поделиться своим путем в WordPress и тем, что этот проект значит для меня.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Кто я?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я швед, но живу за границей последние 23 года. Мне нравится технологии в целом, а IT и телекоммуникации в частности. Я люблю писать и делаю это регулярно на трех языках: английском, шведском и русском.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>За последние 30 лет я был менеджером проектов, менеджером по продуктам и менеджером по изменениям, главным образом в телекоммуникациях и IT. Жил и работал в десяти странах мира, в разных культурах. Я руководил малыми и большими командами, работал как на месте, так и удаленно. Работал и у поставщиков систем, и у операторских компаний (стартапы и крупные, зрелые компании). Я вел как проекты в традиционном стиле, так и руководил Scrum-командами. Как видите, у меня богатый и разносторонний опыт.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Кроме этого, между проектами, я также много лет работаю профессиональным переводчиком и редактором (на английском, шведском и русском). Языки моë особое увлечение.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Как я пришел в WordPress</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я начал вести блог на русском языке на другой платформе в начале 2005 года. Спустя пару лет я начал писать стихи и короткие рассказы на шведском. В начале я публиковал эти тексты нa специализированном сайте.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В 2011 году я решил собрать большую часть своих произведений в одном месте, и выбрал для этого WordPress и построил свой собственный трёхъязычный сайт. Я до сих пор помню, как неожиданно легко было перенести мой русский блог с ЖЖ на WordPress, уже в 2011 году.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Первый вклад в экосистему WordPress</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я исправил русский и шведский переводы моей темы, и отправил их разработчику той самой темы, чтобы и другие люди могли пользоваться ими.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Активное участие</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress увлëк меня по-настоящему. Время от времени я помогал друзьям и семье настраивать простые сайты. В благодарность за то, что мне дал WordPress, мне захотелось внести свой вклад в проект.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>За месяц до выхода WordPress 4.7 у меня появилось немного свободного времени. Как профессиональный переводчик, я смог быстро предложить сотни строк для шведского перевода и тут же меня назначили общим редактором шведского перевода (GTE). После этого я начал расширять и наставлять шведскую переводческую команду.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Но это ещë не всë!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Как опытный Project Manager и Change Manager, я стремился лучше понять общую картину и помогал переводчикам на другие языки, когда у них возникали проблемы и вопросы. И вскоре я стал представителем команды и глобальным наставником.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>С тех пор, я вносил вклад в развитие WordPress различными способами: как соорганизатор WordCamp в Стокгольме, как соорганизатор нескольких переводческих мероприятий, как активный участник команды поддержки (особенно в шведском форуме поддержки), выступал на конференциях, и многое другое.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В последнее время я активный член команды, которая популяризирует участие в развитие WordPress среди пользователей. Для новых участников проекта мы максимально облегчаем вход в проект. Я также был ментором в двух пилотных группах нашей новой программы по наставничеству. Оптимизация рабочих структур и процессов мне хорошо знакома по моей профессиональной деятельности, как Project Manager и Change Manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я хочу, чтобы сообщество WordPress становилось крепче и устойчивее. Есть много работы, особенно в формировании сильных команд в разных странах, для перевода, обучения, популяризации и поддержки WordPress на языках всего мира.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я буду рад внести гораздо больший вклад в эти процессы. Идеальным вариантом было бы стать полностью спонсируемым участником. Так я мог бы максимально приносить большую пользу.

I&#8217;m really excited to dive into this new podcast on the Do the Woo Network with some of my friends in the space. This is an intro episode to discuss what&#8217;s to come, what this podcast is about, what we&#8217;re looking to accomplish, and our ideas for the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are looking forward to discussing large, complex topics within the enterprise space, especially related to WordPress, that you don&#8217;t hear much about. I&#8217;ve brought on some heavy hitters to help with this. We&#8217;ve got an awesome host group, and I want to go through who you can expect to see on the show from a host perspective. We&#8217;ll also talk about show formats, guest ideas, and some partnerships we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll kick it off. I&#8217;m Brad Williams, CEO of an agency called WebDevStudios. We&#8217;ve been working with WordPress for 16 years, and over the past 6-8 years, we&#8217;ve focused on the larger-scale enterprise space. We build complex web integrations and websites, pushing the boundaries of what WordPress is known for and proving its value in the enterprise space. I&#8217;m excited to share my experiences with my company and the amazing things we&#8217;ve done with our clients and partners. I&#8217;m also looking forward to hearing what my co-hosts have to share from their experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we&#8217;ll bring on Karim Marucchi with Crowd Favorite, also a CEO. Karim, why don&#8217;t you tell everyone a bit about yourself, your company, and what you&#8217;re bringing to the table?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Thanks, Brad. I&#8217;m Karim Marucchi, CEO of Crowd Favorite. I originally came to the WordPress world from the traditional enterprise CMS world. I helped bring some of the first organized CMSs to the enterprise and eventually found my way to the open source and WordPress through working with large organizations that were tired of licensing fees. Crowd Favorite specializes in making WordPress a hub for a more extended content management system, plugging into legacy systems and the MarTech 10,000. We do things for enterprise clients that go beyond just pushing words and images to a page, and we get really excited about that. I&#8217;m looking forward to these conversations and think it&#8217;s going to be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Absolutely, I can&#8217;t wait as well. Next up, our third host, certainly not the least, is Tom Willmot, also CEO of Human Made, another well-known agency in the WordPress space. Welcome to the show, Tom. Tell everyone who you are and a bit more about your experiences in the enterprise and WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Sure, excited to be here. Human Made was founded back in 2010, and we&#8217;ve always been focused on the large enterprise side of WordPress, working with large clients and contributing to WordPress to make it a better CMS for enterprise. We also started Altis, a full enterprise WordPress hosting solution. We&#8217;re all involved in the Scale Consortium, a collaborative effort to raise the game for enterprise WordPress. It&#8217;s an exciting time for enterprise work, and there&#8217;s a lot happening in the broader enterprise CMS space. We probably don&#8217;t talk about enterprise enough in the WordPress space, even though it&#8217;s a big driver of growth and investment. So, I&#8217;m excited to cover both sides of that in this show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, 100%. I can promise the viewers there will be no lack of acronyms and buzzwords on this show. We will do our best to explain these acronyms and try not to gloss over them. I&#8217;m really excited because we all have different backgrounds and experiences. Karim came from a traditional enterprise space into WordPress, while I started an agency from scratch and stumbled into enterprise. Tom has his unique experiences as well, especially with Altis. The different perspectives will bring a lot of flavor to this show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scaling Enterprise Podcast will be a biweekly show released through the Do the Woo network. If you&#8217;re subscribed to Do the Woo, you&#8217;ll see when a new episode of Scaling Enterprise is released. We&#8217;re planning on one show per month focused on the enterprise within the WordPress space and another geared towards open source software. Karim, why don&#8217;t you talk about your thoughts on the topics and how it will differ from the WordPress-specific show?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />Sure. Sometimes inside the bubble, we forget that open source is key to making all things possible for our clients. The WordPress project is a great platform to connect to other things. While one show will focus on how we relate to the WordPress project, the other will address questions our clients have about broader topics like AI, first-party data, and the DXP world. We&#8217;ll explore how open source and WordPress give the enterprise more choices than any other platform out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, I love it because it allows us to expand beyond the WordPress bubble in our conversations and the types of guests we bring on the show. It also lets us focus more. One show will be dedicated more inside the bubble, and the other a bit more outside. We&#8217;re always looking for feedback, so if you&#8217;re listening and interested, we&#8217;d love to hear your topic ideas, thoughts, and guest suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s talk a bit about the partnership we have on this show. We&#8217;re working with Bob and the Do the Woo network, but this is also a partnership with the Scale Consortium, of which the three of us are members. Tom, can you dig into what the Scale Consortium is, its goals, and who&#8217;s involved?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />The Scale Consortium formed just over a year ago. Initially, five of us agencies got together to work out the structure, and it&#8217;s now expanded to 10 agencies. We&#8217;ve been focused on marketing WordPress to the enterprise. We&#8217;ve done a series of WordPress platform-first case studies showcasing amazing examples of WordPress as an enterprise platform. We&#8217;ve got a video showcase coming up soon, highlighting exciting recent launches in the enterprise space. The idea is to share the load of marketing WordPress to enterprise and do a much better job than we each individually can, allowing us to focus our marketing on what makes our agencies great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />It&#8217;s amazing to see agencies, even though we&#8217;re competitors, come together to help grow WordPress in the enterprise. It&#8217;s important to combat the FUD content that tries to drag WordPress through the mud. We can push back on that with a unified voice, showing that WordPress is secure and widely used by big companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karim:<br />The biggest measure of our success is if a stakeholder or procurement specialist in the enterprise can find all the information they need about WordPress just as easily as they can for other monolithic content management systems. That&#8217;s what Scale Consortium aims to provide. We&#8217;re representing WordPress as a future-proof solution, giving enterprise customers more options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Exciting stuff. I can&#8217;t wait to dig in. I would love to spend the whole hour here, but we&#8217;ll keep this short and sweet. We have a big event coming up: WordCamp Europe. The three of us will be there, along with someone from almost every agency in the Scale Consortium. Bob will be there too. If you&#8217;re attending, track us down. We love talking about open source, WordPress, and how it impacts the enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The show will officially start this summer. You can subscribe on Do the Woo to know exactly when the first full episode drops. Any closing remarks from anyone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I think we covered everything. It would be great to hear from people who are listening now. Let us know what&#8217;s on your mind, the kind of stuff you&#8217;d like us to talk about, questions, and concerns. Send us a tweet or seek us out at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Definitely reach out either through Bob, online, or at an event if you have ideas or are interested in coming on the show. We have a lot of flexibility in what we&#8217;re doing and how we want to run this podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that, we&#8217;ll wrap it up. Look for us at WordCamp Europe, subscribe over at Do the Woo, and we look forward to hearing your feedback and having some fun talking about WordPress, enterprise, open source software, and all the challenges and fun that come with that.

The Grammarly-level editing and spell-check alone is amazing, on par with their math stuff. Some of these superpowers will be directed into blogging, and I can’t wait to see what people do with all these new generative tools at their disposal. I really love the Promethean model where all of us have devices in our pocket or desktop that can turn us into superheroes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it’s actually going to turn the hosting world upside down because complex transformations that would be difficult to run on the server-side will be trivial to run client-side with these millions and billions of processors being distributed through people’s smartphone upgrades. This innovation should exist at the operating-system layer (I include browsers  and <a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\">WASM</a> in this) not be replicated in every application. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/playground/\">WordPress Playground</a> plays into this trend. (Interesting that Apple has now started to adopt the playground terminology.)</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jun 2024 02:35:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 12.5.1 Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=334282\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://buddypress.org/2024/06/buddypress-12-5-1-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2858:\"<p><a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.12.5.1.zip\">BuddyPress 12.5.1</a> is now available.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> A pivotal moment in my WordPress journey was when someone invited me to a WordCamp. I was sort of aware of WordPress, but certainly not aware of the community or the ways of open source. And when I look back, there were a few things I wish I had known going in. I am, of course, an unapologetic extrovert and therefore unstoppable at events, but if you are headed to your first WordCamp and are feeling a little nervous or confused, then pop in some earbuds because the next 10 minutes are for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We&#8217;re going to first take a look at some basic tactical things about WordCamps, and then I&#8217;m going to tell you a few, like, human things about being a human going to events. If you&#8217;re a dog going to these events, I think that your prep is different, but also that is not my area of expertise. So the first thing, some tactical stuff about going to WordCamps. All of this happens before you even get in the front door. And so this is stuff that you can do in the comfort of your own home, on your own time, using your own computer. If you&#8217;ve got questions, you&#8217;ve got a search engine nearby to take some quick searches. Make sure you know what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first things first, the shape of a WordCamp. All WordCamps have at least one day of talks, one social event, and sponsors to connect to. Some also have extra events that you need to sign up for, like Contributor Days, workshops, things like that. But we&#8217;ll start with the main event, right? We&#8217;re going to start with the day of talks and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So when we&#8217;re looking at the main event of a WordCamp, what you should do is you should head to the WordCamp&#8217;s website and check out the schedule. I suggest that you plan for two, maybe three things that you might want to learn and look around at the schedule to see if there are any presenters or presentations that look like they fit those things that you think you might want to learn. Because if it&#8217;s not working for you, if it&#8217;s not teaching you something, then you don&#8217;t necessarily need to be in that one. Even if you&#8217;re not sure about a session a talk that you&#8217;re planning to go to, I recommend that you stop by, and then if you find out that it&#8217;s not for you, you can leave again.  That&#8217;s fine. But I do encourage you to go to at least one thing that feels a little bit outside of your comfort zone. Even if you feel lost right now. It at least gives you an idea of what to search for once you do get to that point. I would never have known the things to search for early on in my learning of WordPress without going to at least one or two sessions that were just way over my head. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Second thing is don&#8217;t forget to check when lunch is available. And if you have dietary restrictions, let them know ahead of time. I realize this sounds silly, and I don&#8217;t know about you, but I can&#8217;t focus when I&#8217;m hungry. But also, it&#8217;s really a great, low-stakes networking time, and I think one of the overlooked networking times as well. I mean, everyone&#8217;s gotta eat, right? And it&#8217;s easier to strike up a conversation over a meal than just out of thin air or, you know, in the middle of a presentation when you&#8217;re supposed to be listening to a talk. So yeah, check out when lunch is happening! And yeah, make a friend or two, sit down at a table, and ask somebody what they&#8217;re doing with WordPress and how long they&#8217;ve been doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing that I would recommend that you do when you&#8217;re looking at kind of the main event for a WordCamp is to schedule in time to wander around and meet the event sponsors. They are all experts in some WordPress problem or other, so probably they have a solution to a problem that you have got. But they&#8217;re also how we keep our prices super low, so even if you have no problems or you think you have no problems. Still, check them out. They&#8217;re also staffed with wonderful people that are building really cool stuff with WordPress and so you might just get some inspiration out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now for the side events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the side events, we&#8217;re going to kind of start close to the main event and work our way out. So you&#8217;ve got generally three types of side events if you don&#8217;t count the networking things, which, in this case, I&#8217;m not. But just know that almost every WordCamp has some networking event, either an after-party or, like, a happy hour, a social that happens before the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll get emails about those if you have signed up for updates on the website. Also, you can look on the website directly. Just check out the schedule. Always go to those. The networking is the best at a WordCamp. But the side events—we&#8217;re talking about specific types. Like I said, we&#8217;re going to start close and work our way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, workshops. These are just what they sound like. They&#8217;re classroom-style opportunities to practice the things you&#8217;ve learned at meetup events or on learn.WordPress.org, depending on how you found your way to this WordCamp. They mostly happen during the WordCamp itself. in a separate track, and there are like stacks of workshops in that track in that series of sessions. But a lot of them do require preregistration simply so that the trainer has an idea of how many people to expect. Again, if you get in the workshop and it&#8217;s way over your head, you feel like you absolutely cannot get it done, you&#8217;re always welcome to leave and check out some other area. But, in general, the workshops that we have WordCamps are pretty solid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a little bit further removed from that are our Youth and Teen Days. So this is more of an event series that is specifically designed for teens or kids who are trying to learn more about WordPress and other related business and entrepreneurial topics. It&#8217;s kind of a catch all but also has a lot of WordPress content in it. They have age limits, of course, and require separate registration for safety and planning purposes both. And those, in general, are either half-day during the WordCamp itself or a full-day during that WordCamp. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us then to the big one, the major side event. This is a full-day side event called Contributor Day. If your WordCamp has a Contributor Day, it will happen either the day before or the day after the WordCamp itself. It is an entire day where attendees come together to learn how to contribute to the future of the WordPress open source project. Now, if you are listening to this as part of, like, you&#8217;re getting ready to go to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what I meant by open source or open source project or WordPress open source project, that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You&#8217;re going to learn all about it at the Contributor Day if you go, but the TLDR is that this software that you are about to choose to build your website on is built by thousands of people across the planet who are looking for the best solutions to problems that they have in their businesses that probably you will encounter or have encountered before. There&#8217;s no new problems under the sun, and open source methodologies kind of use the collective wisdom of everybody who has ever worked with a WordPress project or site and ran into a problem that they had to solve on their own, like this open source project, this community of people just make sure that that wisdom is collected and standardized and made available for all of eternity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all you need to know. Low key. I&#8217;ve made Contributor Days sound so calming. However, that is a whole day thing. It happens before or after the WordCamp. It has separate registration so that organizers of your WordCamp can plan for how many folks need to be there to teach new and returning contributors, what to do. If I&#8217;m going to be honest, if you&#8217;re going to get overwhelmed at any WordPress event, it&#8217;s going to be one of these, but they are well worth the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Even if you just make a single contribution and never return, which I hope is not the case for you. I hope you do return. Even if you make a single contribution and never return, there&#8217;s something really grounding about seeing how much expertise and time, and care goes into this software that is, against all odds, completely free. So that&#8217;s all the tactical stuff, or a lot of it anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It at least gives you a sense for what you&#8217;re getting yourself into for your first-ever wonderful WordPress weekend. But I promised you some human stuff too. So here is my considerably shorter list of stuff to bring as a human being going to a WordCamp. There&#8217;s an optional one. I&#8217;ll start you off with an optional one. Come with an idea of what you think you want to learn. You don&#8217;t have to come with that if you don&#8217;t want to. Some of us don&#8217;t know what we don&#8217;t know yet, and that&#8217;s fine too. But if you have a sense for what you think you need to learn, you&#8217;ll have an easier time figuring out how to spend your time while you&#8217;re here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, the non-optional things. Bring some way to exchange information. It can be QR codes, business cards, or pen and paper. It doesn&#8217;t really matter as long as it&#8217;s something that works for you to be sharing information with people that you meet. Because you never know when you&#8217;re going to meet your business soulmate, but the odds that you&#8217;re going to do it at a WordCamp are pretty dang high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing to bring is bring what you need to be comfortable. Bring your water bottle, a change of shoes if you need it, spare battery for your phone, your glasses. This day is going to be long enough without worrying about small inconveniences. So bring what you need to make yourself comfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And finally bring your bravery. You will not know by looking at someone whether they&#8217;ve been doing WordPress stuff for two years or two weeks. But you can know that at some point, they were in the first two days of trying to figure this all out. One of the most endearing things about this community is the zeal they bring to solving a problem. So if you get lost or stuck, just ask the person next to you. We all remember what it was like to know nothing, and we are rooting for you to succeed. And that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s your whole list. That&#8217;s everything you need to know to be the most prepared first-time attendee to a WordCamp ever. If that all sounded more overwhelming than just showing up, don&#8217;t worry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also just show up. That&#8217;s what I did. And even though I knew next to nothing, those WordCampers made me feel welcome and included and kept me coming back to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Ah, WordCamps. Gosh, I love those things. So glad that we&#8217;re all getting back together for them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] (Music interlude) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now, my friends, to our small list of big things. If you&#8217;re a first-time WordPresser, if you&#8217;ve never been to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what any of these things are, don&#8217;t worry; you can still go take a look at them, or you can wait until later when you&#8217;re less overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, but this is our small list of big things for middle of the year 2024. First thing on my list, the gender equality in WordPress businesses survey is still open. It aims to gain critical insight into the gender composition of leadership teams, the experiences of women and gender-diverse leaders and employees, and also take a look at the challenges and barriers to their career success. I care deeply about making sure that we have a way for folks who are traditionally and historically underrepresented in technology have a way to get into our space. Obviously, women and nonbinary folks are an area that I feel particularly called to help build those on-ramps for, but I have a great concern for that across the entire ecosystem and any intersection that we run into as we get more and more users into our space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you are a woman, if you work with women, if you work in WordPress, if you work in a WordPress business, go take that survey, and let&#8217;s see what we find out about what it&#8217;s like to work in this space, as somebody that we normally don&#8217;t see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our list is that WordCamp Asia 2025 dates and venue have been revealed. So WordCamp Asia 2023 and 2024 were both major successes, and we are excited to share that the dates and venue for next year will be February 20th, 21st, 22nd in 2025 in Manila, and you&#8217;ll be able to go over to that website, take a look at it, we&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes as always and maybe start planning your your next big Asian adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on my list is this new contributor wizard questionnaire. So, there are more than 20 teams to contribute to in the WordPress project. They all show up at those Contributor Days that I talked about. But there are more than 20 of them. They work on different parts of the WordPress project every day. And our passionate community offers contribution opportunities for everyone. I know, we know, that finding the right team is the key to a meaningful contributor experience. So, our interactive questionnaire is here to help you determine where to start. It is sometimes difficult to know whether you can contribute to a software if you are a designer, if you are a writer, if you are in marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it turns out that you can contribute to WordPress with a bunch of skills that you otherwise would not have realized. So, we&#8217;ll have a link to the questionnaire in the show notes again. Also, it&#8217;s probably going to pop up on WordCamp sites, Contributor Day sites, anything that helps you all understand where you might find a little bit of success as a contributor is a good place for it to be. Take the questionnaire, see where you land, the WordPress sorting hat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And item number four. So we&#8217;ve made some updates, not we&#8217;ve made some updates, we have some updates from the Five for the Future program. So the Five for the Future program has a long history in the WordPress project. There are a couple of different episodes in this podcast where you can learn more about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, to bolster transparency and openness, we have an update on the current state of WordPress contributions as of the end of May 2024. In the past few months, we&#8217;ve made a lot of efforts to improve the program and contributor experience in WordPress. We&#8217;ve also done a little bit of work to kind of clean up the pledges that are in there for, people or companies or teams that have found that they couldn&#8217;t continue their contributions over time. That is fine too. But we&#8217;ll have a link to that update in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org.

Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:36] (Music outro) </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 10 Jun 2024 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"Do The Woo Community: Press Release: Do the Woo 4.0 Official Launch: Elevating Voices in the WordPress Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=84172\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://dothewoo.io/do-the-woo-4-0-official-launch-elevating-voices-in-the-wordpress-community/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4895:\"<p><strong>For Immediate Release</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Europe, June 9, 2024 — We are thrilled to announce the official launch of Do the Woo 4.0, marking a significant milestone in our journey to build a vibrant community for WordPress and WooCommerce builders and businesses. This launch coincides with the first day of WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2018, Do the Woo has evolved through continuously, growing both in content and community engagement. The decision to move Do the Woo to its own site in late 2022 was the first major step for the future. As we entered 2023, our mission began to extend beyond WooCommerce to encompass the broader WordPress ecosystem. The idea was simple: elevate voices and create a podcast by the community, for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of 2023, planning for the new started and in October, we solidified our efforts, with the goal of showcasing the diverse range of the Do the Woo podcast channel with our shows. With significant support from WordPress.com, this vision became a reality, culminating in a redesigned site that went live in March.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, we start our prelaunch. The official launch will be on June 13, 2024, when we will proudly unveil the fully developed Do the Woo 4.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key Features of Do the Woo 4.0</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Comprehensive Podcast Lineup:</strong>&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With the official launch, we now have a total of 12 shows and 26 hosts, including our latest addition focused on enterprise WordPress and open-source software (OSS).

Something that I talked about as far back as the beginning of last year. Yes, that’s right. Then in March I said it would be delayed. In that podcast I shared several ideas, some of which will never see the light and others, well, we will see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m glad I delayed because since then we have had a lot of twists and turns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what’s the point and where am I going with this about the coming week. As many of you know Do the Woo will have some solid representation at WordCamp Europe this week. And guess what? We are finally celebrating Do the Woo version 4.0. The official launch. We did a soft launch when we redesigned and migrated the site to WordPress.com which we shared in March. But we are ready to dig in and tell you all things Do the Woo as we kick it out into the wild in all of its glory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow you will hear the kick off for a new show we have. One that has been in the works for sometime and likely the rounding off of our show growth. And yes, I will give you a hint. Think Enterprise</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week you will also hear a conversation I had with Jay Walsh from WooCommerce about our impending launch. A casual conversation between us that led us in a few different directions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday it’s launch day. And that’s all I’m going to say for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, whether you are at WordCamp Europe or not, I hope you follow along. From all the shows and hosts you have listened to over the last few months as they have grown, you will get a better view of the big picture of what we are doing, and will be doing here at Do the Woo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are on X, follow the hashtag DTW40 for specific posts and shares around our launch.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordPress 6.6 beta one. The last three Gutenberg plugin releases 18.3, 18.4, and 18.5, and WordCamp Europe, not necessarily in this order. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source project, sponsored the Automattic’s five for the future program. Today, I&#8217;m also happy to have Magdalena Paciorek as co-host with me. Magda has been one of the shining tutorial writers for the WordPress developer blog, and I&#8217;m also looking forward to learning more about building custom post types with blocks at WordCamp Europe. It&#8217;s definitely a topic that many developers have questions about. Magda, welcome to the Gutenberg Changelog podcast. Thanks for making the time today. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Hi, Birgit. Yeah, I&#8217;m great. I&#8217;m happy to present the new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome, awesome. So happy to have you on the show. So please tell us all more about you, where you live and what is your day job when you&#8217;re not writing for the developer blog, or presenting, or being a co-host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Okay. I live in Poland and well, I&#8217;m basically a WordPress developer. I work in the marketing department, where I do maintenance of our websites that are built with WordPress. I&#8217;m mostly responsible for maintaining our blocks that we built for our team, so that they can build landing pages for marketing purposes. So that&#8217;s where my interest in Gutenberg came from my team, because that&#8217;s what I do in my everyday job, but I also work in marketing, so I write content around WordPress. I present at WordCamps and other WordPress events. My company also sponsors WordPress events, so I would always also attend these events. So yeah, so my work life is pretty much also WordPress, and also sometimes after work, because of the community that I&#8217;m involved with. So it&#8217;s a big part of my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Do you have family?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: No, I don&#8217;t have kids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Wonderful, wonderful. So you might not have seen the tweet by Luis Herranz, &#8220;By the way. I think this is the best tutorial on the interactivity API available so far. It&#8217;s going to be my new recommendation for anyone looking for a quick introduction to the interactivity API.&#8221; That&#8217;s great. Kudos from one of the lead developers on the Interactivity API project, so congratulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Well, thank you. I actually haven&#8217;t seen it, because I haven&#8217;t looked into Twitter for a long time, so wow, this is nice. Yeah, I&#8217;m really happy that I could contribute to this project, because I feel like the interactivity API is one of the most important features that are coming to work. I mean, it&#8217;s already in WordPress, but it&#8217;s just the first iteration, but I feel like when it&#8217;s going to be finished, wow, this is one of the most important things that is happening right now in WordPress. So yeah, it&#8217;s well cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and you help people to get acquainted with it. So thank you for that. And I agree with you, the interactivity API is probably the most interesting pieces also for people that come over to Gutenberg and from PHP developers, that are not so much interested in JavaScript, but they can also use that and hydrate their pages with interactivity, without page loads. So it&#8217;s really cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So before we go into the Changelogs and talk about all the releases that are happening since we last had a podcast, well the 100th episode was a special episode as you dear listeners already know, hopefully. And so, we skipped a Gutenberg release and now we are putting it all in one show, and you will also notice that at the end of the show, that there will be a different music. And I thought, okay, for the next 200 episodes, I think it would be good to change the music, the intro music and the outro music, but to not confuse listeners right away, we didn&#8217;t do it for this one, but only for the outro music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next time we will have it on. So at the beginning of the show, just to warn you, it&#8217;s a totally different vibe on that music. While I have you, dear listeners, at the beginning of the show, I wanted to also let you know start with a few announcements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements of Upcoming Development Hours, WordCamp Europe and Hallway Hangouts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp Europe is happening next week and there will be awesome presentations there, and I put together a list of the seven block-related talks that you will see in the live stream. So I will link it in the show notes, but one of them is Elena&#8217;s presentation. Then we have a presentation on the interactivity API with Michael and on block themes, and all the good things that come with 6.6, or are already in WordPress. It&#8217;s also Jessica Lessig is talking about the Twenty Twenty Four. Then Erica Gill and Luis Rosales talk about migrating from two blocks from a legacy website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernie Rider, developer on the Gutenberg team, talks about the block hooks, how to extend block themes, and then there&#8217;s also the Gutenberg speed build challenge that Jamie Marsland has put up on YouTube, and you will get to see it live. And we just found out that Jessica Lessig and Rich Tabor are the contestants, so that&#8217;s going to be really cool. And then, Jamie also has a talk about the three key principles for beginners on blog themes, and then of course Magdalena&#8217;s building custom post types blocks. So you see this all and you can get this all through the WordCamp Europe live stream, if you&#8217;re not there to watch it live.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are three developer hours and two hallway hangouts scheduled in the next few weeks, so on June 11th, and of course all of them will have recordings and resources to share. So June 11th will be a developer hour on exploring overrides for the sync patterns that come with WordPress 6.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a very exciting feature and I&#8217;m really looking forward to using that. It was punted from 6.5, but the developers took a totally different approach now. One is they use the block bindings API to drive all the overrides, and then also you have to name the pieces so they can be displayed in the sidebar, but we are going to talk about it a little later. But that is definitely something you don&#8217;t want to miss, or want to catch on the rerun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On June 17th, no, it&#8217;s the 19th, sorry. On June 19th at 1100 UTC there will be a hallway hangout on building a workflow for themes with the CreateBlock theme plugin using Playground and GitHub. So you could use Playground to make all the changes to your theme. Use the plugin CreateBlock theme block theme plugin to save those things, and then use also Playground to save it all back to GitHub as a PR for a theme update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s going to be really cool. And then on June 25th, there&#8217;s developer hours on what&#8217;s new for theme developers in WordPress 6.6. That&#8217;s more an overview and kind of sometimes deep dive. And then on June 26th, a day later, 1100 UTC, there will be a hallway hangout on the grid layouts that come to WordPress 6.6, and we will discuss all the cool things with Isabel Brison, who was one of the lead developers on the grid layouts. And then July 2nd, and that&#8217;s the end of it. July 2nd is again another developer hours and building theme with the CreateBlock theme plugin, so you can learn more about all that. So that&#8217;s it. Discussions and QA also happen asynchronously, in the Make WordPress Outreach Channel, that&#8217;s a new name for a channel that was the FSE outreach experiment, but it&#8217;s now a standard channel on the WordPress makeup for extenders, developers, site builders to come together and discuss things, or have Q&amp;A with people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, join us there. All right, that brings us to what&#8217;s released.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.6 Beta 1</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most, but not all items in the Gutenberg plugin releases we&#8217;ll cover today will come to WordPress 6.6 version at the end of July. I think release date is, no, release date is July 26th, but you can already start testing WordPress 6.6 beta 1 version, because it was just released and I would like to point out that it&#8217;s the best way to learn about new features coming to the WordPress version, when you heed the call for testing. It has been out for together with the WordPress 6.6 beta 1 release, and you get to test 10 features coming to WordPress 6.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those are all the new data views that are in the site editor for pages, templates, patterns and template parts, and how they kind of work the same pattern overrides, so you can change the content of a pattern per instance, and then if you change the design, all the other patterns will change the design as well, but not change the content. So the updates to the insert are showing all blocks. A user feedback was there that it was a little bit confusing. It now shouldn&#8217;t be, but test it out. Unified and refresh publishing workflow. We have additional information about that later on. And then, mix and match the typography and color palettes from all style variations, and then section styles, and the changes to CSS, cascading style sheets, specificity. That&#8217;s a very difficult word, specificity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. And then, another feature coming to WordPress 6.6 is a grid layout, and then a new pattern experience for the classic themes. I did some brief testing with a classic theme activated and it works real nicely. Also, the sync pattern works as well. Of course the sync pattern overrides are only enabled for certain blocks, so it does not work on all patterns, but that&#8217;s a different story. Another feature that a lot of people have been waiting for are the negative margins in the UI of the global styles. And then, there is a feature also coming to WordPress 6.6 that allows for the rollback of auto updates if they run against some error message, or something like that. A team of developers has been working probably for, if not longer, a year on that, and now it&#8217;ll come to WordPress 6.6 and it&#8217;s definitely great to test this. Now Magdalena, are there any features in 6.6 release that you are particularly excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Well, yes, quite a few of these features are really exciting, but I&#8217;m the most excited about sync pattern overrides. I think this is a very important feature, especially for people who build websites for clients, because it solves the problem that the page builders basically have, that you build views of pages, and then you have some common elements that you add to a few pages for example. But then when you want to change something, well you had to visit every page separately and make these changes. For example, change background code. And so, that&#8217;s of course, if you have a very small brochure website with five pages, not a problem, but it doesn&#8217;t scale, the website grows, then it&#8217;s not really usable. So these synchronized patterns that you can overwrite are a really great solution for this, because you can keep styles synchronized, but then allow overwriting text for example, the content of these patterns per page. So it&#8217;s a great feature, I really like it. I think everyone should get interested in it actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I think a lot of people got already excited for 6.5, when it was pulled off the beta 1, because it wasn&#8217;t ready yet, but I think the additional two or three months maturing of the feature definitely helped to make it even more clear how to assign those allowed overrides, and how a user that uses them, an editor that hasn&#8217;t created them, but wants to use them, can identify the areas where they can override things. Now there are a few caveats there. One is that the overrides are only enabled for headings, paragraphs, buttons, and images, and in images only for the alt text and the file name. So if you put captions in, the captions are not part of the overrides. So somebody did some great testing there and you need to, if you want to test it out with captions and yeah, it&#8217;s probably not going to work as you expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: And there&#8217;s one more limitation, because I&#8217;ve tested it with gallery block and you can override the images, but we can set them to be able to be overwritten. But the problem is when the number of photos that add to the gallery, it can&#8217;t be changed. So if you add for example, two pictures, there can only be two, they can be three or one. So it&#8217;s not a hundred percent usable, but I&#8217;ve read the discussion on GitHub, and I feel like this is going to be solved in probably the next release, but for now, this is something to be aware of. Also, the same situation with the list book, where you have a few items, and then you can&#8217;t add or remove these items from the async pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, list block is not part of that. Yeah, that&#8217;s true. Gallery block is not assigned yet that it works. So yeah, those are the limitations, but for a first version to get in a major WordPress release, it&#8217;s in really great shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yes, yes, I confirm it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And every other feature, there&#8217;s a good first version and then we iterate on for the next steps on that. So yeah, I&#8217;m also quite excited about the section styles and the grid layout, because that&#8217;s also a part of what other page builders do, is that you can assign different styles to sections and not have to go to each part of it. So if it&#8217;s a cover block or a groups block of certain elements, you can change all the colors with a color palette kind of thing, and assign a style to it, and have that on a button change over to either dark view, or light view, or blue view, or red view kind of thing. But you don&#8217;t have to do it for each single block in that group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are really time savers, but they also give designers a little more granular control over the designs that they create. And the grid layout is definitely something that a lot of people have been waiting for, that you arrange everything on your page in a grid, and then you can wrap the handles of a block and kind of make it larger, or have a row span of a block, be it an image, or a paragraph block, or anything, and to organize the blocks differently on a page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that really helps with that, some people are still looking for pixel perfect, although that one went out of the window when we had mobile, and different kinds of screen sizes and we now have. I don&#8217;t know, from brownie size screen to big TV screens that are 80 inches. So yeah, we need some fluid things there. And the grid layout, if you use the automatic grid layout, it will be responsive and adhere to the various screen sizes. And negative margin is part of it as well, with the section styles and the grid layout to give more tools to the designers to have really great designs that are not following conservative flows of content and assets. Well if your listeners have a comment on that, just use the comment section on the website and let us know what you think about all the new features that are coming to WordPress 6.6. And as I said, go and test it, heed the call for testing, and you learn all about it quite by doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 18.3</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to the first Gutenberg plugin release that we are going to cover. That&#8217;s Gutenberg 18.3. There were 165 PRs in there. It was released on May 8th, by 44 contributors and three contributors who were first timers, Jason Crist was the release lead for that release. Well, one definitely stands out is that Gutenberg is updated to a new React version. I think it&#8217;s 18.3, was it? I&#8217;m not quite sure. Yeah, it&#8217;s just a coincidence that 18.3 Gutenberg release also uses React 18.3, so I was a little confused at the moment here. And that will be important when you use some of the newer features, or if you have to update some of the legacy React features on your blocks. I&#8217;m not quite sure how much of a disruption that is or if it is at all, but I just wanted you to be aware of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yeah, this one I don&#8217;t actually know. I&#8217;ve checked it out, but I couldn&#8217;t make it work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay, yeah, that&#8217;s a different story. It&#8217;s a different story. It doesn&#8217;t have to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Okay. It&#8217;s there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Everything needs to be tested of course, and it&#8217;s supposed to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Onto the next thing. Also, the plugin document settings panel is now available, a slot is available in the template inspector controls, because before this release it was only available I think in post inspector contract, but now it&#8217;ll be also available in the template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The site editor. Yeah, and that is so plugins can have additional fields and create their own little interfaces there. The next one is classic themes get now exposure to the patterns page, and what it also removes is the template parts menu item. So classic themes now have access to the site editor design for patterns and template parts. There was a request from quite a few theme developers if that would be possible, or agency developers if that would be possible, because then they can also do all the documentation, everything for the patterns can be also used for classic themes, or users that use the classic theme. So that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciore</em>k: Yeah, that&#8217;s a great feature. And also patterns, the data view is changing. The team has removed icons and right now it&#8217;ll just have this label that says that if the pattern is synchronized or not. So yeah, that&#8217;s also a really nice improvement. Small, but very useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And one other PR I wanted to point out is that now you can insert patterns on the end of the canvas, or the route section of a content piece. Until then you couldn&#8217;t get to that. It was really hard to put anything on the end of a post or pages, but now you can insert patterns to the end of it by drag and drop, or just by using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yeah, this is a really nice usability improvement. I actually tested it and it worked really nicely. It&#8217;s a natural flow. It seems very natural to add new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You can now just drop and drag them to the end, because then you can stack your patterns first before you make all the changes that you need to do on the page. So you can get a really good layout very fast to just combine a few patterns, and you don&#8217;t have to rearrange them on your site. Next one is a new text alignment control component that&#8217;s for developers, when you have a few&#8230; Most text aligns are actually in the block toolbar, but some of the blocks don&#8217;t have have it in their block toolbar, but you can have it in the font section, the typography section of that block, so you can have a left center or right alignment on the text, even if the block toolbar is not there. So it&#8217;s really cool. That&#8217;s especially helpful also for custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yes, and we also have a new improvement on the inserter tabs, because now the search bar is moved into inserter tabs. So when you type, for example, you look for the keyword, like for example, image, and you look on the block tab. Then when you switch to the patterns tab, then you still have this search phrase there and it already filters out the patterns based on this keyword. So this is a really nice improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I saw that too, and I really love that, that I don&#8217;t have to tap in my keywords multiple times just because I&#8217;m going from blocks to patterns to the other thing. Well, I mentioned it with 18.3 Gutenberg plugin. There is now the possibility to add negative values to margin controls. So you can have overlaps, so you can have a picture and then the next paragraph you can have the margin negative 200, and it goes a little bit into the picture on the bottom of it if you want to do that. That is something that many designers have done for many, many years with just plain Cascading Style Sheets, and it was available through the theme JSON where you could add negative margins already, but now it&#8217;s also coming to the user interface, and it will be in the dimension controls on the bottom of the margin, you can see add your negative values for any of the margins, be it left, right, top or bottom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: In the next feature, I think it&#8217;s only relevant for the team developers. I think so, because there is a big change to how the style variations are handled in Orpheus 6.6. Okay, so another feature is I think it should only concern the theme developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Are you trying to tell me that this is something that developers actually wouldn&#8217;t be able to use, or that&#8217;s not for developers that it&#8217;s actually just Gutenberg internal?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: I think it&#8217;s internal for Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So we don&#8217;t talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yeah, yeah, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If it&#8217;s not for extenders, then it&#8217;s not really&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: I don&#8217;t think they have to do anything. It&#8217;s just how it handles when you define two or three type variations, and then people mix and match it, so it&#8217;s something internal that handles it. Not to create too many styles under the hood, something like that, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I think I saw another filter to have the color controls and the typography styles, that they are not duplicated and all that. The team is working on that. That&#8217;s the next one, is the filter out color and typography variations. That&#8217;s also an internal one, but I think it could open up the system for the next version to be able to maybe opt out of the presets, the automatic creation. So color and typography variations when they come in, they are taken from the style variations the theme has, and isolates in a separate section, all the color palettes that come with the style variations, and in a separate section also all the typography choices that could be made for the style variations. And there is a discussion for extenders. Well, if a theme is following brand standards that has four style variations for the different brands of a company, then you don&#8217;t want colors from brand two and the typography from brand three to be maxed, and that is not yet available to opt out of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think how the filters were created, I think it would only be a small step to provide that opt out for theme developers. So I think we need to watch that space quite a bit in terms of what feedback is coming in from the beta version, and also see how that can be solved. It might not be part of 6.6, because we are six weeks away from release, but there might be time. So it&#8217;s certainly something to discuss with theme developers, agency developers, and the good mood developers. Which also brings us to the new preset, there are default font sizes in theme JSON version three, that for those you can opt out of course. Core has a few font sizes in the theme JSON and provides some. So those don&#8217;t have to be worried about theme developers if they don&#8217;t want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Especially if you create a custom for a company, then you might want to opt out from the default font sizes and declare your own ones. And onto the next one. There are some changes in the post editor sidebar. There are a few data information about the post was shuffled around in the top area of this site editor. For example, post status work count, also the thumbnail was moved to the top of site panel. So there are quite a few changes that I&#8217;ve seen throughout these three releases of Gutenberg that we&#8217;re talking about. So it&#8217;s not a big change, because the data is still there, the same data, but it got moved up or down, and I think at the moment it&#8217;s looking quite nice. It&#8217;s quite usable, so it&#8217;s definitely worth it to take a closer look at how it looks like at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it definitely is a change that gives you much more information about the nature of the post or the page that you have. And I&#8217;m seeing that the word count might disappear from the inserter, no from the list view tab, because not a lot of people are going there, but you have all the information in the top section of the post editor. And they also moved up the featured image, and that is part of the also data views, because now they can use the same component and show off in a grid layout for pages or posts. They can show off the card with the featured image, and just the post metadata about their post status, and word count, and last edited information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s also a feature that comes in actually is the duplicate post feature that you can just grab from that section, where you can say, okay, duplicate that post and then restart a new one. Up until now, you actually had to use a plugin for that, and right now it&#8217;s actually only available in the Gutenberg plugin. I&#8217;m not sure it comes to WordPress 6.6, I need to research that. So you might get too excited now, but if you use the Gutenberg plugin, you definitely have it, but it seems to be only for the plugin right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: But it&#8217;s such a needed feature, just to be only available through plugins, but now it&#8217;s coming to WordPress, it&#8217;s really great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so now we have documentation. There&#8217;s a lot of going on in the documentation field, especially the editor package of Gutenberg. The documentation for this package was updated and at the moment I think almost all components are documented, so it&#8217;s great for developers who want to use these components from the editor package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It definitely made some strides with the documentation on the components. Some of the components actually moved from one package to the other, because of the synchronization from the site editor and the post editor. So there is no duplication of code anymore, but they had to move the packages. And so, they also moved some of the documentation and made the discovery that some of the components were actually not documented well enough. So there were two birds with one stone so to speak. Speaking of moving the interactivity, API documentation has also moved from the package area to the reference guide area. When you go to the developer.wordpress.org/block editor documentation, you&#8217;ll find it under different heading in the reference guide and another update that you as if you do theme development or create themes for clients, you definitely want to look at the documentation for the theme JSON version three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are quite a few changes and you need to declare it in your theme JSON, which schema you&#8217;re following to make sure that you are still compatible. All right, that was 18.3. See that was pretty harmless. Cool. Yeah, we&#8217;re getting better at it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 18.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to the Gutenberg 18.4 release, which was released two weeks ago with 185 PRs, merged by 58 contributors, seven of them were new with their first merge PRs, and release lead was Alex Lende and he has all published release post what&#8217;s new in Gutenberg 18.4. So let&#8217;s dive in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first item I wanted to point out was that the grid layout, visualizer and resizer features have been stabilized, and we can always cheer about that. The listeners, I think grid layout is going to be the new gradient. I had an early times on the podcast, even with Mark Uraine. Again, I was always very happy to say gradients and new features, and now it&#8217;s grid layout with new features. I&#8217;m really happy about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yes, this feature is definitely going to be useful, very useful, very excited about it. And the next feature that&#8217;s coming, this Gutenberg version is the aspect ratio presets are now supported through theme JSON. So you can define your own aspect ratios for images basically. That will be available in the controls for the cropping images. So I think this is great, especially for the theme developers, that you can now have your own dimensions of the images that are custom to the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it definitely makes some nice designs when you can have images uploaded and they follow your personalized, so to speak, aspect ratio presets. Also, there was an update on color variations. I mean, the PR isn&#8217;t very descriptive what that means, but it is that it moves the color presets to the palette tab in the global styles. So there will now be a palette section in the sidebar, in the right sidebar under the global styles, where you see palettes, and then you click on it and it gives you all the palettes that are set for the themes, or the style variations, or something. So it&#8217;s a nice UI change. It also follows quite a few other design tools that have a similar feature. So I&#8217;m really glad about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Okay, the next change is interesting for developers, because it&#8217;s a change to the register block style function. This function now accepts an array of blocks and it used to accept only a string with the block name. So what it means, you can now register a block style for multiple blocks at once with this one function, and you don&#8217;t have to do it separately. So this is nice if you have some common style that you would like to apply to a few blocks, you can do it at once. Now with register block site function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s an excellent explanation. Thank you so much. Because I wasn&#8217;t quite sure when I read this beyond what actually changed, but now you can have the green border with the yellow background on not only the paragraph block, but also the group block as well, as the cover block, so you don&#8217;t have to write the code multiple times. And then, the next thing next is more about the block library. So some blocks have additional features, the list block has now block class name on the list, that is really, yeah, people were waiting to style the list block. It&#8217;s now the WP dash block dash list class, so you can style the overall list as well. I think the list items already had their own class names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: And also, the new variation was added to the embeds block in Bluesky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What&#8217;s Bluesky?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: I don&#8217;t know, I have no idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Bluesky. And yeah, the proliferation of social networks is kind of going on and on and on. And Bluesky is a new social network that comes close to Twitter now, and it was actually founded by a former Twitter developer, and it kind of opened up now to the public. It was for two years now, just on invitation only, but now more people can go into Bluesky. They&#8217;re still not ready to open source it, but I think they at least open it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now you can have your social embed Bluesky posts as well with the embed block. So make block popover component public, meaning that now developers can also use it. And that is an additional block toolbar that you can use to kind of put your own stuff in there. I&#8217;m not quite, and have your own navigation pretty much in the block toolbar. I really am eager to try that out. I only saw some WooCommerce implementations, but I have not yet seen any documentation about that. So it definitely has the label needs dev note on the PR, but I&#8217;m excited about for any extension that is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: And the next thing is a new keyboard shortcut was added. This shortcut, which is common G or Ctrl G, you can now create a group from the selected box. So we can select a few blocks and then with the shortcut, the group will be created for the&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s really nice. Yeah, it removes the searching for menu items that are kind of multiple levels deep in the block toolbar settings. The next one is enhanced block outlines and selection interactions. That means that you know where interactions happen, and there&#8217;s a blue outline on certain sections, and group blocks and all that. I think that has been a major improvement on the UI when you create content, that you actually have the outlines where you are and what you&#8217;re doing. I think with the sync patterns, those outlines also become quite important to signal where is the place where I can override some of that from sync pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: In this version of Gutenberg also, the documentation was updated. We have quite a lot of items on the list, but I think it&#8217;s worth mentioning there were some new pages added to the interactivity API documentation about and FAQ. So I think it&#8217;s really important to read about it, as the interactivity API will have become more and more important in themes, especially in theme creation. I think it&#8217;s good to learn about it and I&#8217;m happy that the team provides the documentation for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I just want to highlight that for the interactivity API, there is some change that in the block JSON, you started to put in view script and that changed to view script module. So for the developers who have already been testing out some of the interactivity API directives, that&#8217;s a slight change. It&#8217;s not a breaking change, because I think they put in the controls, but just make sure that that is something to update. Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much all I wanted to point out, except I mentioned it before that the pattern overrides, they&#8217;re now using block bindings API. So the pattern overrides are its own source for the block bindings API, but it follows the same block markup notation. So you could use a pattern and rewrite some of the block bindings or some of the overrides in code if you&#8217;ve ever wanted to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think it opens up the feature to maybe even be available for themes to add it to the theme patterns in further releases. Not for this one, but because it uses a common API. And if that is already in the markup of a pattern that comes with a theme in the patterns folder, those overrides could even be updated through a theme update or those patterns could even be updated through a theme update. So when the theme developer has a new way of designing those patterns, they could override the certain things and then every site who has that theme gets an update to it. That is actually a dream of a block theme developer right now, but I think with the pattern overrides using that block bindings API, it might come to pass. Definitely not in 6.6, but maybe 6.7 or 6.8. All right, I&#8217;m talking maybe I haven&#8217;t rolled that out, but it&#8217;s definitely on the list or it&#8217;s on the roadmap so to speak, to make those extensible. So we&#8217;ll see how that happens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 18.5</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That concludes our Gutenberg 18.4 and we are going right into Gutenberg 18.5 was released this week. The release lead was Vincente Canales with 295 PRs, just short of 300 PRs. That&#8217;s a mammoth release. There were also more contributors, and 71 contributors and 10 of them with first time contributors. So great. It&#8217;s not surprising that there are so many PRs in there, because Gutenberg 18.5 is the last Gutenberg plugin release that goes into WordPress 6.6 from the feature set. So everything after that, and if it&#8217;s a new feature or something that will not be part of WordPress 6.6, only bug fixes get in. So if there was an enhancement that needed to be made and to be valid for 6.6, it needed to get into that plugin release. And as we all know, if it weren&#8217;t for the last minute, not a whole lot would get done in the world, so we were all kind of just in time on some of the features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I promise you we would talk about some of the post summary updates. In 18.5, we had quite a few that were the sidebar for the documentation settings, or document settings, or post settings, or page settings. So you get some post format controls. They moved around the URL and the author on it, the trash button has been removed; it was too prominent. It&#8217;s now in the three.menu, where you also find the duplicate post feature and also the remove feature. And then, there is a post sticky setting is now a tarter. Yay. Anything else that if I get something? Oh yeah, the revisions panel is also under the three point menu, so if you want to look at revisions, you need to go three point menu and then click on the revisions. So it&#8217;s all a little bit well organized. Some of them new designs or the alignment was kind of adjusted and some of the features were not removed. They were in the three.menu. I think it&#8217;s important to know that because it looks a little bit different in the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yes, it definitely does. I also checked it out and at first you might be surprised, there is no trash button, there&#8217;s no revisions panel. But yeah, it&#8217;s just hidden under the menu, so it&#8217;s good to know about it. And then the next change in Gutenberg is how the custom CSS is handled, because you can add your custom CSS to override the ones that you can choose from the controls. Before, whenever you change the variation, the style variation, you would lose the changes to custom CSS that you&#8217;ve made. But now they are saved, and so you can switch the variations and your custom CSS will override the variation, the style that is in the variation. So yeah, actually this was needed, so it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s an enhancement. I think that&#8217;s a bug fix, because there was pretty much the expectation of anybody who put in custom CSS, that they are not disappearing when you&#8217;re just going to switch on the variations. You can make the argument on the other side as well, but I think the user put in the custom CSS, because neither the theme nor the variations gave them what they needed. So yes, that&#8217;s definitely a good bug fix. I don&#8217;t know if you checked out the data views, just as on our aside, the data views, they&#8217;re really coming together, and I like the modern look of that, and I wish they would come earlier to WPAdmin. But if you go to the make design site, Joen Asmussen just showed off the designs for the media library, and to bring some of that new admin also to the media library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they have great things to come. And I am going to share that design share from, I share the link to the design update, but Joen Asmussen in the show notes, so you can look up what&#8217;s in store for the next version or at least for the next time. That was just an aside. Yeah, I like the grid views, I like the layouts, I like the different actions. The only thing that I don&#8217;t like is when you look at the drop-downs in the data views on the right-hand side, they&#8217;re on top. They&#8217;re all kind of overlapping and it&#8217;s hard sometimes to see which one level deep am I looking at now. And for what I think there needs a little bit more refinement, but I think they&#8217;re really glorious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yes, because there are quite a few options to customize it to your needs. I really like it. I really like it that you can bring the thumbnail featured image to the list. It&#8217;s great. I think it was missing in all the current WPAdmin list, but here you can just switch it on with a click. It&#8217;s great. And also, I think the metadata, I don&#8217;t know if at the moment, but at some point I think it&#8217;ll be able to also switch it on the list view. So yeah, it&#8217;s very useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m really looking forward to what other plugin developers are going to do with it for their own plugins, because of course that&#8217;s a pre-built component. Why not use it, when everybody else knows how to use it already? So use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: But it&#8217;s not ready for extending, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, no, well, not as the old admin. If you have in your plugin create a list view of something, some data, like you go out and grab some data from Spotify or something like that, and you want to display that in an admin section, you could use the list view component. That&#8217;s a public component that you could use for that particular plugin page. If you use custom post types, it&#8217;ll still be the old one, because that&#8217;s just the same interface, but because it&#8217;s not yet available for posts, it&#8217;s only for pages. So though there are some things that still need to be happening, of course. But yeah, if you have a separate page for your plugin settings or something like that, use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: You can use the component, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You can use the component, yeah. And it has I think some good documentation on these things. Yeah. All right. Where were we, side of the data views?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: I think we&#8217;re on the background image, add support for relative theme path, URLs, and top level JSON styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What that means is that you can now set a background image for the body content if you want to through the theme JSON, and add it to the assets folder of your theme. And then everybody who uses the theme can use the background image. You don&#8217;t have to upload it through the media library to get it to be recognized as a background image, which is one step further that any theme developer would want the user to have to go. That sounded weird, but yeah. Yeah, you&#8217;ll figure it out. So the next thing is, as we had the default font size spacing in 18.4, I think in 18.5 theme JSON, or it also comes with default spacing sizes. So you can create your own presets for spacing the margins and the dimension, or the dimension controls through the JSON. And it&#8217;s theme JSON version three, so you need to look at the documentation that&#8217;s also been updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: And you can also create and edit shadows in the global styles now. So there is a new control for that, but I must say I haven&#8217;t tested it, so I don&#8217;t really know how it works. But it&#8217;s great to see it, that you can create it in no code in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There will be in the global styles, there is now typography, and colors, and layouts, and now you also have a fourth one that&#8217;s called shadows. And then you can log all the things that you want to style on the shadow. It&#8217;s the color, it&#8217;s the angle, it&#8217;s the blur character and that. So you can really create your own styles, and it shows up on every block that supports box shadows, but it&#8217;s not all of them. And then there are presets as well that come in the natural, deep, sharp, so you can give them names as well, and add them to your global styles. So it&#8217;s the position, the blur, and the spread, and outside range set on the shadow. So they will show up with the core shadows, unless you disable the core shadows through the same JSON. So it&#8217;s not entirely, you cannot do this through the interface, but yeah, you can definitely create some nice shadows. It&#8217;s almost as good as gradients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I like all these design tools that you can use. So the block style variations mechanism is now extended, so you can do section styling. I think we mentioned a similar PR earlier today, but you can create sections, and then you can do block style variations for that. Oh yeah, we did this, that you can apply certain styles to multiple blocks. Now you can create sections, and then attach block styles for that. I think we should have better naming conventions, but it&#8217;s what we have right now. We need to make sure, because we have the style variations, we have block style variations, then we have section styling. It&#8217;s all kind of getting a little bit convoluted, complex, but we&#8217;ll figure it all out. I&#8217;m definitely sure that once everything is in place, we can combine it and do it how we need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: And so, the next feature is block bindings, and especially the block bindings panel that is now added to the block inspector. So when you bind certain attributes from the block to the post meta, and then they will show up in the block inspector in the site panel, so that you&#8217;ll know which attributes are connected to the meta. So I think this is really nice, because you get to see what is connected. And before, I think it was only, you can only tell it is binded by the violet like icon, or something like that, by the color, but there was no way of telling what is connected to what. So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely an improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely an improvement. Yeah. Yeah, the icon was that kind of connector icon in purple on the block toolbar, but you only could see that per block. But the bindings panel, you see all the pieces, all the data that is connected to that block. And where it also tells you, because you can, for the block bindings, you can assign custom data sources. So it also adds the data source to the inspector controls. So you know okay, this comes from post meta, this comes from another data source, so that&#8217;s nice too. I really like it. And they also, that comes together with that, allow editing of the post meta source. So if you have a URL somewhere or an additional data point in the block, you can actually change it there. And it&#8217;s also then updated in the post meta table that comes with it. They didn&#8217;t put in a nice video or so they used to do it with the PRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, here it is. So now you can edit in the block canvas, change the data, and then it will be updated also throughout every block that uses that metadata for that particular post item. So if you have that binding also for the archive templates, it&#8217;ll also be updated in the archive templates, wherever that particular post meta is showing up. So that&#8217;s a pretty cool feature. I think that is something that was never possible with WordPress until this time, that you can actually have additional custom fields be edited through core. You always needed a plugin for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most developers went with advanced custom fields, but there are also others that allow you that. It&#8217;s certainly not as rich as advanced custom fields. So you can&#8217;t do field groups and all that, but it definitely gets there sooner or later. And I really like it. Yeah, it&#8217;s really cool. That can be, it also an answer to what happens to all the meta boxes that were on the bottom of the screen. So if you bind them to a block, then you don&#8217;t have to create a custom block for that. You just need to create the binding for it. So I think it gets there where a lot of people wanted the block editor to be in year two. Well we are in year, year seven, but they needed a lot of other things to come in place before this happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: But this is such a powerful API, the block bindings API. It&#8217;s also one of the most important APIs that are coming to WordPress right now. And it&#8217;s worth mentioning and it&#8217;s worth getting interested in that and learning how to use it. Especially if we build with blocks, we don&#8217;t really want to have these meta boxes on the bottom of the editor. So this is a great way to get rid of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And also, for plugin developers, that they don&#8217;t need to go through all the hoops to create blocks for some of the things that they could do just in block bindings. There are two articles on the developer blog, one part one and part two, where the block binding has been a tutorial on using the block binding API. And I will share the links to those in the show notes. So Justin Tadlock had one that says, building a review site with block bindings. And the part one covers the custom fields and block variations. Part two will be released later in a couple of days. And that is about how to actually create input things in the inspector controls. So it&#8217;s kind of a predecessor. So if you don&#8217;t want to wait for WordPress six to come out, you can use that variation, but sometimes it might be just more user-friendly to use those inspector controls and control them yourselves, rather than use what comes from the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we need to find a way if we could actually switch them off at some point. So I&#8217;ll share those articles in the show notes of this podcast. All right, again, a lot of documentation went in this release documentation, updates in this release, it&#8217;s all about components and blocks, and I think they updated the JSON docs for a lot of components. So they actually are automatically graded from for the documentation. So I think these are the changes for that. Check them out. All right. Wow, this was a long show.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s probably about an hour. So I think we come to an end of this show. Magdalena, thank you so much for being here and going through this with me. Explained quite a few things that I didn&#8217;t understand. So I&#8217;m really happy that you joined me today. When people wanted to reach you or connect with you, what would be a good place to catch up with you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: I think the best place would be on LinkedIn, because that&#8217;s what I use as social media. I&#8217;m not that active on social media, not like I&#8217;m everywhere. But yeah, if you reach me out on LinkedIn, then I&#8217;ll get the message. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So I&#8217;m going to share that information as well in the show notes. Is there anything else that you want our listeners to know about your company, or your presentations, or there&#8217;s an article coming out, I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yeah. Well, I need to start writing, but I would like to invite everyone to my talk at WordCamp Europe, happening next week. I&#8217;ll be covering some of the things that we&#8217;ve talked about today, like pattern overrides or block bindings. And also, I&#8217;ll be sharing some of my, I don&#8217;t know, experiments also that I&#8217;ve done with Gutenberg with custom blocks. So I hope this will serve as inspiration of how we might create post types in the future. Maybe we could actually create them now in this new way, a new block way, block editor way, not in the custom fields way we used to do, or how it&#8217;s still popular to create them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this talk, I think it&#8217;s mainly, I&#8217;ve made it for people who build websites for clients, so like agencies and freelancers that maybe want to take a look at how you could build this typical for agency websites, in the new approach, like you build it with blocks, with some custom code as well, but in a different way that you would do it with, for example, ACF. So yeah, so I invite everyone. I&#8217;ll be talking I think in the morning on Saturday, on the second day of WordCamp. So I see you in Torino. I&#8217;m super excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah. And I&#8217;m definitely going to be there, unless it&#8217;s Saturday, I need to see, I&#8217;m seeing on track one, so I&#8217;m not quite sure if I&#8217;m going to be there. But I will definitely catch it on the rerun through the live stream video. And I will share that also on that particular single post on the Gutenberg times about the WordCamp Europe. So yeah, and I&#8217;ll see everybody who is going to be in Europe and in Turin next week, and I hear the others on the next Gutenberg Changelog podcast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as always, the show notes will be published on Gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is podcast number 101. And if you have questions or suggestions, or news you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:Changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com\">Changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com</a>.

The difference is that Developer Hours are prepared structured presentations while Hallway Hangout are more informal discussions with lots of input from the attendees.

I&#8217;m Francisco Torres, just a normal developer working with WordPress for many years. You might recognize me by my pequeño bigote, which is Spanish for &#8220;little mustache.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to invite you to my session called &#8220;WordPress.org Plugin Repository: A Year in Review.&#8221; In this session, I&#8217;m going to tell you a story about how the directory needed a new team of volunteers, how we got there, what we are doing to improve it, and what plugin authors can do to contribute to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One crucial aspect of developing WordPress plugins is ensuring they are secure. A significant number of WordPress vulnerabilities come from plugins, so it is essential to follow best security practices. The most common security issues we see are related to the absence of input sanitization, output escaping, and nonsense during user requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please keep that in mind if you are developing or planning to develop a plugin. I will be sharing other best practices during the session along with stories of how the plugin industry has evolved over the years and how you can play a part in this journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join me to learn more about the Plugin Review team, the challenges we face, and how you as a plugin author can contribute to making the WordPress plugin ecosystem safer and more reliable for everyone. Looking forward to seeing you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Irene Strikkers: How to leverage Analytics data to find out where you lose potential customers</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Irene: Hi, my name is Irene Strikkers, and I&#8217;m a data insight expert at Online Dialogue. In my daily work, I help organizations optimize their websites by doing user research, data analysis, A/B testing, and all forms of experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp, I&#8217;ll be doing a lightning session called &#8220;How to Leverage Analytics Data to Find Out Where You Lose Potential Customers.&#8221; As a website owner, you want to sell as many products as possible, gain newsletter subscribers, or have people read many of your blogs. However, people on your website might drop off somewhere before they buy, subscribe, or read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my session, I will show you how you can make funnels in Google Analytics or other analytics software to find out where they leave. That way, you know where on the website you might need to improve. One of the main takeaways of my talk will be to experiment with possible improvements before deciding to implement them. That way, you validate that the change is actually an improvement and won&#8217;t lead to extra drop-offs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d love to invite you to my talk on Saturday afternoon to learn more practical tips on how to make funnels and how to experiment with solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Held: Think like a hacker: Attack your WordPress</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt: Hey, welcome to WordCamp Europe 2024. This is Matt Held, and I&#8217;m super excited to be speaking in Torino this year. This time, I&#8217;m going to teach you how to hack a common WordPress site as well as properly defend it in my session, &#8220;Think Like a Hacker: Attack Your WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you might be thinking, why would I want to learn how to attack a WordPress site? Know thy enemy—in understanding how hackers operate, you gain a huge advantage when it comes to defending your own sites. As you can imagine, knowing where hackers and bots might attack and what they can find makes you a much better defender, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During my talk, we&#8217;ll start by exploring the mindset of hackers and threat actors, it&#8217;s like stepping into the shoes of a digital profiler. Together we&#8217;ll discover how they spot vulnerabilities, exploit weaknesses, and wreak havoc if given the chance. This is where the fun begins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will have ourselves some good old live demonstrations of real hacking techniques—a live hack. You&#8217;ll see exactly how a hacker can compromise a WordPress site from weak passwords and outdated themes and plugins to sneaky SQL injections, cross-site scripting, and much more. And here&#8217;s the best part. You&#8217;ll be able to follow along and try these techniques yourself. Think of it as a hands-on workshop where you get to play the role of both the villain and the hero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start getting any funny ideas, remember, this is all about learning how to protect your site. So after we&#8217;ve had our fun breaking things, we&#8217;ll switch gears and focus on defense. I&#8217;ll show you practical steps to safeguard your site against the very attacks we just discussed and why a security-first mindset will save you lots of headaches and hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of my session, you&#8217;ll have a toolkit of strategies to keep your WordPress site safe and sound. To give you a sneak peek, here&#8217;s a quick tip. When was the last time you checked if you have a WP-config backup in your WordPress file system? Check it now, and if you have it, delete it. And please rotate all your credentials, including database user passwords as well as WordPress salts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I promise this session will be packed with valuable insights, practical tips, and maybe even a few laughs. Whether you are a WordPress novice or a seasoned pro, there&#8217;s something for everyone. So come join me at &#8220;Think Like a Hacker: Attack Your WordPress&#8221; and let&#8217;s learn how to be an attacker to become better defenders. The session will be on Saturday, June 15th at 12:15 PM on Track 2. See you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jessica Lyschik: Twenty Twenty-Four: Pushing Default Themes Forward</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jessica: Hey everyone. My name is Jessica Lyschik, and my talk at WordCamp Europe in Torino is called &#8220;Twenty Twenty-Four: Pushing Default Themes Forward.&#8221; As I was the co-lead for the 2024 theme, I will share with you not only the vision behind the theme but also what features it offers, including how we made it accessibility-ready and much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, we will first take a look at the previous default themes, and maybe you will see what all of them have in common. For making it accessibility-ready, we had to ensure sufficient color contrasts throughout all style variations, created a screen reader-friendly headline style with an icon, and made sure all page templates have a correct semantic headline structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have also picked various websites that I will show you as an inspiration, which are all using the 2024 theme under the hood. This was a sneak peek of my talk, and if you want to learn more, join me on the first conference day on Friday, June 14th at 11:15 AM on the main stage in Track 1. See you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam Zieliński: WordPress Playground – use WordPress without a server</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam: Hi, my name is Adam Zieliński, and my talk is &#8220;WordPress Playground – Use WordPress Without a Server.&#8221; Playground is a groundbreaking new technology that brings the workforce to all devices and ecosystems at the click of a mouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the many things I&#8217;ll show you during the presentation is how to build things and even sites with nothing but a phone—no internet connection, no hosting plan. Come and join the presentation in Torino and also say hi afterward. I can&#8217;t wait to meet you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie Keith: We spoke with over 50 different WordPress product owners. Here’s what we learned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie: Hi, I&#8217;m Katie Keith, founder and CEO at Barn2 Plugins. I&#8217;m doing a talk at WordCamp Europe with Matt Cromwell from StellarWP, and the title will be, &#8220;We Spoke with Over 50 Different WordPress Product Owners. Here’s What We Learned.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will be sharing the best advice that we have received from all the WordPress product owners we&#8217;ve interviewed on our WP Product Talk podcast. A major theme of the talk will be listening to your customers. This is essential to building a successful WordPress product or indeed any type of product because, without knowing what your customers want, it&#8217;s practically impossible to create something that meets people&#8217;s needs and that they will want to pay for and use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to customers cuts across literally every part of running a WordPress product business. First, you should use it as an opportunity to get ideas for products in the first place. For example, if you are currently providing WordPress development services for clients, then listening to their pain points is an excellent way to find gaps in the market. Perhaps you can even use a plugin you have built for a client as a starting point for a commercial plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you start building your product, it&#8217;s also important that your users can input into the design of the software. This</p>\n\n\n\n<p>might involve things like user acceptance testing, which could be formal or simply mean asking a few friends or clients to test your plugin. This is a great way to make sure it&#8217;s intuitive to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the product is launched, your customers are an excellent source of marketing ideas. At Barn2, we send feedback request emails to all customers a few days after they make a purchase. These emails ask them where they heard about the plugin and even what they typed into Google to find it. I get very excited when they mention a keyword that I haven&#8217;t optimized for yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you need to listen to your users to make sure they&#8217;re receiving good customer experience. Think about the customer&#8217;s journey at each point of using your product and consider what they need in order to be successful with it. This can lead to all sorts of new ideas, such as better documentation, onboarding emails, intuitive setup wizards, regular webinars where they can ask questions, and offering different types of support to meet different needs, such as live chat or even phone support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as you can see, putting customers first is an excellent way to plan a successful WordPress product business and should inform everything you do. We&#8217;ll be talking about this in more detail and lots more at WordCamp Europe, so don&#8217;t miss the talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lourens Schep &amp; Damián Suárez: Ready to try the new WooCommerce product editor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawrence: Hello everyone, I&#8217;m Lawrence, and this is Damien.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damien: Hello, I&#8217;m Damien. The both of us are excited to be leading a workshop at this upcoming WordCamp around the new product editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawrence: Yes, we are. I just came from WordCamp where we also led a session about Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damien: Exactly. Yeah. Damien, do you want to tell a little bit about yourself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damien: Yes, sure. I consider myself a simple man who, among many things, has worked as an independent web developer for a long time. Long enough not to mention it here so as not to give away my age, but let&#8217;s say I&#8217;ve been part of the Automattic company for over 10 years. Like almost everyone else, I like to do all kinds of things except paperwork and end-to-end tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawrence: And where do you live?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damien: Oh, sorry, I forgot to mention it. I was born in Argentina but recently moved to Portugal. How about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawrence: Yeah, I currently live in the Netherlands. I recently moved from Canada, where I lived for the past 17 years, but originally I was born in the Netherlands. I&#8217;ve been a developer with WooCommerce for just shy of four years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had the privilege to work on the new product editor over the last year and a half or so, and for the rest, I tend to be a pretty active guy. I enjoy playing sports, volleyball, bouldering, things like that, and staying fit while at the gym and enjoying watching a bit of soccer too. So I&#8217;m excited that Euros is kicking off the same weekend as this WordCamp. Go Netherlands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damien: Nice. Talking about football, do you want to compare the number of stars or maybe actually let&#8217;s stay on track. What is next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawrence: Yeah, let&#8217;s definitely stay on track. I prefer not to talk about that and I&#8217;m rather glad that the Netherlands doesn&#8217;t have to play Argentina in, but anyway, we&#8217;ll try not to make too many soccer references during our workshop. Bob asked us to share a useful tip or a tease for our workshop. So what is your statement?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damien: Oh, yeah. Here&#8217;s a tip for the workshop. One could be how to extend this product application, for instance, part of the user interface using the Gutenberg API, because in the end, we are using Gutenberg as a framework. What do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawrence: Oh, shoot. That was going to be mine, but yeah, I guess my tip would be for anyone that&#8217;s curious about making use of input components like a select control that Gutenberg provides, this workshop will show you how to use them and bring you one step closer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damien: Yeah, that sounds great. All right. See you there then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawrence: Yeah, come in. Okay, bye. Bye. See you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vraja Das: The Power of WordPress Testing and Automation: Test Types and When to Use Them</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vraja: Hello everyone. My name is Vraja Das, and I&#8217;m a plugin developer at Yoast. The name of my presentation is &#8220;The Power of WordPress Testing and Automation: Test Types and When to Use Them.&#8221; In my presentation, you will learn what automated tests are, the different types of automated tests, and automated tests in WordPress core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing automated tests has benefits beyond just verifying software requirements. Automated tests serve as living documentation of the codebase, help prevent regressions and bugs, and facilitate safer refactoring. They also foster a culture of quality and collaboration within development teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share practical tips on how to start writing tests in JavaScript and PHP, drawing from my personal experience in the field. Whether you&#8217;re new to testing or looking to refine your skills, this session will equip you with the knowledge and confidence to integrate testing into your development routine, ultimately leading to more reliable and maintainable code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benjamin Evans: Introducing Learning Pathways on a brand new Learn.WordPress.org</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben: I&#8217;m Ben Evans. I&#8217;m a community education manager at Automattic, and I work as a full-time sponsor contributor to the WordPress project. Currently, I&#8217;m a training team representative focusing on keeping the administration of the team running smoothly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Europe this year, I&#8217;ll be presenting a talk titled &#8220;Introducing Learning Pathways on the Brand New Learn.WordPress.org.&#8221; There are three big topics I&#8217;ll be sharing in this talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, have you ever visited the WordPress Project&#8217;s official educational website? The site is located at learn.wordpress.org, and we like to call the site Learn WordPress. Learn WordPress launched during the COVID pandemic when there were a lot of changes happening in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the WordPress project is relaunching the site with fresh content and a new design. In my talk, I&#8217;ll be sharing what exciting things await on the new site when it relaunches, currently scheduled for July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second point of my talk will be introducing the new type of content Learn WordPress will be producing. We&#8217;re calling them Learning Pathways. Learning Pathways are curated sets of lessons for learners of different levels, roles, and use cases. The training team is currently working on learning pathways for users and developers, with more pathways for designers and contributors coming next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re on track to publish the beginner user, intermediate user, beginner developer, and intermediate theme developer learning pathways in time for the site relaunch. I can&#8217;t wait to share more about Learning Pathways in my talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, the training team is looking for more contributors to help us make Learn WordPress the most effective educational website it can be. Come to my talk to learn how you can get involved with the Learn WordPress project. We have a world to reach with effective WordPress education, and we need your help to achieve that. I&#8217;ll see you there.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>For each flagship WordCamp, here at Do the Woo we contact the speakers and ask if they would like to record a short intro into their session. Some add a tip, others gives us a little more about who they are. In all cases, you will hear a variety of invites to attend their sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I would like to thank them for finding the time to do this. It&#8217;s a busy time for speakers getting ready for WordCamp Europe, and understand it&#8217;s a bit above and beyond for many. So for all speakers this year, cheers!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fernando Tellado:<a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/re-humanising-the-web/\"> <em>Re-Humanizing the Web</em></a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Camille Cunningham &amp; Florie van Hummel:<a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/keyword-research-101-uncover-keywords-that-bring-you-digital-success/\"> <em>Keyword research 101: Uncover keywords that bring you digital success</em></a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Francisco Torres:<a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/wordpress-org-plugin-repository-a-year-in-review/\"> <em>WordPress.org plugin repository, a year in review</em></a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Irene Strikkers: <em><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/how-to-leverage-analytics-data-to-find-out-where-you-lose-potential-customers/\">How to leverage Analytics data to find out where you lose potential customers</a></em></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Matt Held: <em><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/think-like-a-hacker-attack-your-wordpress/\">Think like a hacker: Attack your WordPress</a></em></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Jessica Lyschik: <em><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/twenty-twenty-four-pushing-default-themes-forward/\">Twenty Twenty-Four: Pushing Default Themes Forward</a></em></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adam Zieliński: <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/wordpress-playground-use-wordpress-without-a-server/\">WordPress Playground – use WordPress without a server</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Katie Keith: <em><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/we-spoke-with-over-50-different-wordpress-product-owners-heres-what-we-learned/\">We spoke with over 50 different WordPress product owners.

I&#8217;m your host Birgit, and today we have a special guest joining us: Laura Adamonis, a dynamic and passionate member of the WordPress community based on the East Coast of the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura owns Add a Little Digital Services, where she provides website design services. Laura&#8217;s journey with WordPress began in 2022. Since then, she has made significant contributions, particularly with the Learn WordPress training team. She dedicates around 10 hours a week to creating tutorials, lesson plans, and workshops, helping users navigate and master WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura is also a team representative for the training team in 2024 and an active member of several WordPress meetup groups. In addition to her work with the training team, Laura is deeply involved in the global WordPress DEIB working group, advocating for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging within the WordPress community. She has also been a speaker at various WordPress events, including WordCamp Montclair. Please join me in welcoming Laura to the show. Laura, it&#8217;s a pleasure to meet you here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Thank you very much for inviting me. I appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Can you share a little bit of your WordPress origin story and what exactly drew you to this community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />As you pointed out, I&#8217;ve only been in WordPress for the last two years. It came about as I was in a job that I loved. I was working at the local science center and got paid to play with Legos. I was the robotics coordinator, which was a fancy title, but I loved that title. I helped kids with engineering and playing with Legos, building with Legos, and robotics using the Lego Mindstorm and Spike Prime materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also supported five to six robotics teams and competed within the FIRST organization, which is a global robotics competition for kids from 5 to 18. It was awesome, but I had to work on the weekends. I wanted something more flexible to spend weekends with my family, so I said goodbye to them. I didn&#8217;t know where I was going to go. I was home, had my list of things to do around the house, and ended up scrolling through social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Believe it or not, social media brought me to a program called WP Rockstar from a company called Geek Pack and Julia Taylor. I signed up for that and spent six months going through the online tutorials. They have a great, women-focused community. I really took my education background, and when I learned something, I would share it with the community and help others who were struggling. It just built on that because I always feel that the biggest thing is being able to teach somebody something to better understand it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found a quote that I wanted to share: &#8220;I do, you watch; I do, you help; you do, I help; you do, I watch.&#8221; That is the basic principle of teaching, eventually having a student teach somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brought me to going through the training and wanting more. It was a program for beginners, and I needed to know, okay, well what do I do with this? Then the block editor started coming out, so I wanted to learn about this because I was using the classic editor, the Genesis framework to code, and basic CSS and HTML. What about this new thing? I jumped into that and focused on the newer thing because people are going to need to know how to go from the classic editor to the block editor. I wanted to be on the forefront to help educate those people. I think that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at right now within the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Wow, that is really impressive. Especially when I hear you talking about how you went into robotics and working with Lego and teaching young children. It&#8217;s very impressive to see. Also, how you pivoted into a completely different career path. When you&#8217;re talking about trying to be upfront on new technologies like the block editor, what inspired you to start your own website design service?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />That was a funny thing. Honestly, it was the next step on the checklist within the training. They&#8217;re like, this is how you start a business: pick out a name, go do this, do that. Looking back, I probably shouldn&#8217;t have done this and just looked for a regular website job, but I always had this name. I had a wreath-making business when I was first married, local craft fairs and stuff. I made wreaths for Christmas, and I came up with a name that kind of went with our last name, Addon, Add a Little. I always liked that. I really wanted to have my own business with that name on it, so that&#8217;s why I use Add a Little Digital Services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have any master plan, and I didn&#8217;t have anybody knocking at my door saying, &#8220;Oh, we want websites, we want websites.&#8221; It was just something to check off. When I start a project, I need to finish it and complete it to the best of my ability. It always irked me because one of the steps within the program was to make a thousand dollars. I was like, well, I don&#8217;t have any clients. It always bugged me that I couldn&#8217;t do that step. But I did everything else within the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a Montessori trained teacher for six to nine-year-olds, and when I did my training, a lot of the people didn&#8217;t finish, but my goal was to finish and complete it because it was a whole summer of in-depth training, two weeks around the winter time, and then come back the following summer for another few weeks and do this big year-long project too. I did this huge notebook on holidays of the world. So that&#8217;s where my diversity passion comes into play. But yeah, honestly, it was just a thing to check off the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />That is really impressive. When you mentioned Montessori, my eldest daughter is also very interested in Montessori and teaching my grandson in a holistic way and challenging him to explore. So it&#8217;s very interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura, you and I, we met for the first time at WordCamp US, specifically at the WordPress Community Summit. You were also one of the invited members to the WordPress Community Summit. Do you mind sharing what your first impressions of the community summit were? What was drawing you to that and what were your key insights?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />It was my first WordCamp and it was local, so it was only about a five-hour drive for me. I love DC. That&#8217;s where I did my Montessori training outside of DC. I loved the area and I had seen that there was this community summit that you had to apply for. I thought, okay, and they were looking for new contributors. They wanted to have a good mix of people who have been in the community, but they wanted new voices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had been with the training team for a couple of months, helping them organize our handbook. A lot of the things in the handbook that I was going through, the steps weren&#8217;t making sense to me. So, being able to look at something and bring that Montessori approach to breaking it down into steps and providing feedback to make things better, I applied. I was accepted, I was so honored to go there, and I didn&#8217;t know what to expect. I just went with an open mind. I&#8217;m a listener, I kind of soak things in, and I wasn&#8217;t thinking to do anything then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was amazed by all the people and that so many were from other countries. It was amazing. I had followed people through Twitter, watched different podcasts and workshops, so I knew people. I had started connecting and networking, which is awesome in this community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I went to the presentations, I had my list of interests: training, diversity, accessibility. I had been following Amber Hines and Alex Stein&#8217;s work. I signed up for your meeting discussion. I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect and how people were going to share. It said that we were going to have open and honest communication, and I didn&#8217;t realize how honest people were going to be, which was awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that hour or two, I felt every emotion in the world, which was good and bad. But I&#8217;m glad that people shared because the struggles people have aren&#8217;t always external. Most of them are, but there are also the internal ones that people struggle with. It&#8217;s those ones that we don&#8217;t perceive first off and kind of neglect. My key takeaways were the honesty that people shared, and I felt the most as a community focused on the same mission within that group of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />When I was facilitating this session about diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, I wasn&#8217;t expecting that big of an outcome. Also, as you said, the openness and that people were really sharing honestly, and they were really vulnerable, sharing their personal insights and feelings in a safe space. That is what I try to accomplish. I&#8217;m really glad it worked out that I opened a safe space with my facilitating for this session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can also echo that at the community summit, there was a really diverse group of people from all around the globe. We got insights from different parts of the world. As a person, you have only a limited amount of experience, so it&#8217;s really good to see different perspectives. As you mentioned, also listen to others and their experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming back to the WordPress training team, would you mind sharing and describing the role you&#8217;ve taken over this year and what a day looks like for you as a contributor to the training team?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Yes, I was asked to help be a team rep. There are three of us. The other two people are on their last year. We usually try and do two years so that they overlap because there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that goes on even behind the scenes administratively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team rep, I facilitate and guide to help the training team stay informed and move forward on our goals and projects. We are kind of in charge of the blog</p>\n\n\n\n<p>posts, and we help out with WordPress TV and the materials that we use for recording and captions and transcripts. We want to be able to have materials in many different languages. We even have a subgroup of translators that will take our tutorials and put them into different languages. We’re excited when we find somebody who speaks a language we don&#8217;t have and is willing to work with us to provide that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team rep, we attend contributor days at WordCamps to help run the meeting and the different activities to try and get new people to contribute. My other job that I&#8217;m passionate about is content creation. I create video tutorials or lessons, and we&#8217;re working towards learning pathways for users, designers, and developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve gone through and created pathways of where to start as a user with WordPress, how to start with, and we&#8217;re doing a beginner, intermediate, and advanced, breaking it into different groups so that a beginner can start with a set of five or ten videos to get them started. We&#8217;ve been updating content that&#8217;s out of date to facilitate that so that things are easier to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first came, I found something and then couldn&#8217;t find it again. Where&#8217;s this lesson plan, and how old is this? Wait, I&#8217;m trying to do this, but I don&#8217;t see the same buttons because it&#8217;s probably three releases old and doesn&#8217;t have the current release materials. The last two years have seen massive changes within WordPress.org. Things are moving so quickly that we can&#8217;t even make the videos fast enough before they&#8217;re outdated. The first one I did doesn&#8217;t look like the dashboard of today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s my work within the training team. It says only 10 hours a week, but I probably put in closer to 20. I&#8217;d love to find a company to sponsor me for more hours because this is what I enjoy. I love designing, but right now it&#8217;s hard to find clients. So I tend to spend more time within the training team, doing tutorials, editing stuff, and researching information to make sure that it&#8217;s current and accurate. The online workshops—I would love to do a workshop each week if I could, but right now I have to juggle everything to make sure that I can do everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Wow. Thank you for all the work you&#8217;ve already done in this short amount of time, especially in training. I feel it&#8217;s a big pillar within the Equitable Pathways and inclusion. Providing better materials or more adjusted learning paths for new contributors or new users to WordPress, and for someone who wants to build their livelihood on WordPress and learn more about how to develop with WordPress, it&#8217;s crucial to lower the barrier by providing training material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really appreciate the work you&#8217;re doing, and I&#8217;m looking forward to finding ways for companies to support contributors like you who are not working on the core software as developers but providing supportive content around it. Maybe our audience already knows about the Fight for the Future initiative, where companies can pledge to support individual contributors or pledge their employees&#8217; hours to work on contributing to WordPress. We will put a link in the show description for anyone interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, as we explored, you and I met at the community summit, and you attended the session on diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. Briefly before WordCamp US, the DEIB working group was added to the WordPress Make Slack. You joined our group. Would you mind telling us what motivated you to join this group and about the intersection between the training and the contribution you are doing for the training and the DEIB working group?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Sure. I wanted to work with you. You were the pillar of the talk, and I wanted to continue what we started in that discussion. I made a couple of friends within that discussion group too, and I&#8217;ve been able to meet up with them, which is really cool and supportive. One thing I learned from being in COVID and previous events in the news here in the US was that I need to be an ally. I need to use my voice to help others because it&#8217;s tough for them, and they&#8217;re worn out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t see me, but I am a white female with blonde hair and blue eyes. I didn&#8217;t realize that I got special treatment compared to others, and that&#8217;s not fair. I wanted to work within DEIB, hearing people&#8217;s comments and struggles within WordPress to make it better. Some of the current initiatives our group is working on include creating a survey for WordCamp Europe to get our community talking about things. I&#8217;d like to further push the handbook, creating an outline or some organization table of contents of what we need to add to or create the handbook. I love that we were on the call with Angela because she knows how the spider web works together and how we can intertwine without repeating the work of other teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Yes, exactly. For the audience, the DEIB working group hosts virtual office hours every second Friday via Zoom, and it&#8217;s a safe space. These Zoom calls aren&#8217;t recorded on purpose to provide a safe space for discussing community issues. If discussions spark, points get posted on our GitHub repository for transparency, but what is shared within the group stays within the group unless someone is open to sharing outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We work closely with the WordPress project leadership. The contributor handbook is also one of my biggest projects. Like you do with the training team, we need a contributor journey map, like a treasure map, to find the ways to get to where you want to be within the WordPress community. How do you feel your work has impacted the WordPress community, especially in training and DEIB? What advice would you give to someone new who wants to contribute, especially in these areas?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />In the short time I&#8217;ve been in the community, I have an amazing network. During my WordPress training, one of the facilitators was using the Genesis framework and the StudioPress theme. So Brian Gardner did a couple of workshops with us. I&#8217;m originally from Chicago, and he&#8217;s in Chicago. I reached out and said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m a Chicago person, can we connect?&#8221; He was gracious enough to say, if you have any questions, just reach out. A lot of people would be hesitant to bother someone of his stature, but I did, and he created this Build Mode weekly meeting through WP Engine, which has become a family of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We bring in new people to discuss what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s cool. If I ever need help or don&#8217;t know something, I have that network, which is pretty amazing for someone who&#8217;s only been doing it for two years. I always tell people not to be afraid to ask a question or ask for help. I&#8217;ve been asked to be a guest on podcasts, and I&#8217;ve done Rob Cairns&#8217; podcast from Stunning Digital Media. I was asked to appear on WordPress Hartford meetups, and I&#8217;m doing my first speaking at WordCamp Montclair this weekend. Slowly, I&#8217;m getting my name out there, and people are seeing that I know my stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve helped improve the training team&#8217;s handbook. It&#8217;s funny because they did a couple of updates and used screenshots of me asking questions or making statements. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Is it okay if we use your walkthrough?&#8221; I said, sure. If it can help someone else, I&#8217;m happy to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advice I&#8217;d give to people is to reach out to me or anyone else within the WordPress community. Just DM them. If you see someone you follow and admire who is part of Core, WordPress TV, or accessibility, just message them. You might have to wait or redo it, but ask the question. Go to make.wordpress.org. The design has been updated to be more user-friendly and easier to find things. There&#8217;s even a test you can take to see which team you&#8217;d be best suited for. There are over 22 teams, so there&#8217;s a place for everyone. Ask your company if you can be part of the 5 for the Future program and contribute while at work. Just that 5% would be a big help. Reviewing one of my video lessons takes 10 minutes and would help a lot. We try to get two to three reviews on each video before posting them to ensure they&#8217;re understandable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Yes, I think there&#8217;s a place and room for everyone. You don&#8217;t have to know how to code to contribute to the WordPress project. Reach out to someone you admire. Looking back to my first days contributing to WordPress, I had members in the German community who published frequently on their blog. I put them on a pedestal. When I went to my first WordCamp, I learned that these people were kind, open, and supportive. There&#8217;s no need to put someone on a pedestal. Just reach out and ask questions. Representation matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone reached out to me after one of my talks at WordCamp and shared that something I said inspired them to pivot into a new career. Even being in someone&#8217;s life for a brief moment can make a difference. You don&#8217;t know how your actions and words can impact someone else&#8217;s life. You can be a hero in someone else&#8217;s life without knowing it. That&#8217;s why I love that Bob offered me the opportunity to run this series on the Do the Woo podcast to get new voices and have these nice conversations about staying connected and loving the WordPress community. Overall, it is a very welcoming and inclusive community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />Shout out to Courtney Robertson, who has sprinkled her magic fairy dust all over with her wisdom. She was one of the people who got me interested. In Montessori, there&#8217;s the premise of the Nautilus, which is a spiral of learning. You might come back around and relearn something, building upon it. I&#8217;ve reconnected with my students who are now in their thirties and taught when they were six through nine years old. Seeing how the things we did back then affected them now is amazing. One of my students, we did a study of South America, and he has traveled the world, speaks Spanish, and married someone from South America. Those little things come back around. We did a craft fair to raise money for the rainforest during that study,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and it influenced him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Wow. Very impressive. Speaking of inspiring and studying different cultures and perspectives, when I officially started contributing to WordPress, I was translating WordPress into German. This opened a gate for me. I learned about the international community and joined the Polyglots group. I learned about the difficulties other translators have and different working cultures. Contributing to a global project, you meet people from Japan, Indonesia, India, Australia, Africa, South America, and all over the world. It&#8217;s very rewarding to learn about different cultures and broaden your horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we approach the end of our episode, how do you see yourself and the WordPress community in the next five or ten years? How do you see WordPress and the community evolving?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura:<br />I hope we stay supportive of each other. We need some younger people within the community. The training team has started pushing our lessons onto YouTube to get better exposure. We need to look at shorter shorts, narrowing down to two or three-minute quick tips for your website. Most people are on phones rather than fancy computers, so being able to design and create websites on mobile devices is important. I see us continuing to grow and be supportive. There was talk of taking a breather, which would be nice. Not doing so many releases in a short period would help us catch up. I hope that conversation continues. I wish everyone well for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Thank you very much, Laura. It was a pleasure talking to you and listening to your advice and experiences. For the audience, thank you for tuning into the WordPress Way. We hope today&#8217;s conversation has sparked new ideas and inspired you to engage more deeply with the vibrant WordPress community. Remember, DEIB isn&#8217;t just about numbers. It&#8217;s about making real changes that foster a sense of belonging and respect for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please keep the conversation going by sharing this episode and join us again next month as we explore more important DEIB topics and meet leaders driving this change. Don&#8217;t forget to subscribe on your favorite podcast platform, so you never miss an episode.

I&#8217;m very good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are one of the few people that I&#8217;ve had back on, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had anybody back on quite as quickly as you are. But this is time sensitive, which is not often the case because we&#8217;re going to be talking about something which is going to be featuring in WordCamp Europe, which is happening in the next few days, actually it&#8217;s about 10 days out. Something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to just introduce yourself to those people who haven&#8217;t come across you before? Although that is now a dying breed of people, I suspect. But do you want to introduce yourself, and give us a little bit of background to this particular topic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:46] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Sure. I&#8217;m Jamie and I run a WordPress plugin business, and that&#8217;s all I do. Oh, and occasionally I do some YouTube videos now, and YouTube&#8217;s kind of taken over. I&#8217;m pretty much full-time content creator, but I do have a plugin business as well. So go and check that out if you&#8217;re listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve been running these WordPress speed builds on my YouTube channel, and I&#8217;ve run about four or five, I think, so far, where contestants get 30 minutes to basically build a website. So it&#8217;s fast and furious, loads of fun. We get loads of people on the live chat. We&#8217;ve had some real stars of the WordPress space on so far, and it&#8217;s coming to Word, WordCamp Europe next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are going to be on the stage at WordCamp with, what, two contestants vying to build the exact same thing in a very confined amount of time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you basically put a website, a pre-built website from out there on the internet somewhere and say, okay, you&#8217;ve got 30 minutes to make that. Go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:42] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, exactly. They haven&#8217;t seen it. They see it when we see it on stage, and then they get five minutes to prep then we start the clock, they get 30 minutes to build it whilst at the same time being hassled by me asking lots of extraordinarily stupid questions, and we get people from the crowd asking questions as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve got to build it while actually commentating on what they&#8217;re doing, whilst getting lots of questions from people as well. So it&#8217;s high pressure. It&#8217;s a great format. It&#8217;s a really short and sharp thing to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So did you initially do it as just a bit of fun to create some content and then unexpectedly realized there was some pearls of wisdom to be gained from it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:21] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, the inspiration came from, &#8217;cause I did, on my YouTube channel for a while, I&#8217;ve been doing website recreations. I&#8217;ve done about 10 or 15 or something. Famous websites I recreate in half an hour. So I&#8217;ve been doing it myself and my channel, just me. And I thought actually this, would be a great format if you had two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It just popped in my head one day. You put two people actually competing to build exactly the same website in 30 minutes. So I put a tweet out just to gauge, as often do, gauge interest and people were really interested in it. And then I approached Brian Coords and Mike McAllister, two good friends of mine, to see whether they&#8217;d be willing to be the first on the show, and they agreed. They were amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we&#8217;ve run about five, I think, so far, with some really famous people in the WordPress space. But it is a very fun format, deliberately fun, and aimed at being fun. But the feedback I&#8217;m getting, especially from people in the WordPress product space, like Ben Ritner from Kadence came on last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They find it really useful from a, just a stress testing, product user testing experience to do that. They&#8217;re finding real value in it, over and above just being a fun format. So it&#8217;s a really interesting space. And there&#8217;s lots of ideas I&#8217;ve got of where we could take it next as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you, give them the same WordPress version? What I mean by that is in the five minutes, are they allowed to go and install into their WordPress website a whole collection of plugins, which may make the job them a little bit more straightforward? Or is it vanilla WordPress, core blocks all the way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, no, they&#8217;re allowed to do whatever they like. So I do a little bit of prep for them. So for example, for Ben, I installed Kadence and Kadence Pro. Over and above that I don&#8217;t really want to install too much, but they&#8217;re allowed to go off and basically install anything that they like. There&#8217;s no limits on, they can go and use Bricks or Beaver Builder or Elementor, but obviously every time they go off and install a plugin that&#8217;s eating up into their time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a bit of a time penalty every time they want to do that. But there&#8217;s no limits. Once the clock starts, they can do whatever they like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And I&#8217;m guessing you are not picking, for example, the Google homepage has got one search field and a logo. I&#8217;m guessing that you are trying to get them to do much more complicated things? Loops and all sorts of other things. Just describe the level of complexity. Are you deliberately trying to the most difficult website that you can manage? Lings Cars, for example?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Lings Cars is coming up at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:40] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely going to come up. Rich Tabor would be, Rich Is coming on this Thursday actually, as well as next week. I mean I just think seeing Rich Tabor with someone with such a defined and beautiful design aesthetic, taking on Lings Cars. It&#8217;s just got to happen at some point. I don&#8217;t think I can stop myself from that happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But you are picking a difficult website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:59] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I&#8217;m picking, what I&#8217;m trying to do is a combination of a few things. One famous, so people know it. That&#8217;s not always the case. But also there&#8217;ll be some challenging, and there&#8217;ll be some good learning for people watching it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s not just 30 minutes of fun, although it is. Cause a lot of the feedback I get, after the 30 minutes is up, we ask the players to go into the back end of the sites and tell us how they built it. And people love that. They get lots of learning from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I try and choose sites which are visually beautiful and interesting, have some challenges, but also there&#8217;s going to be some really good learning for people as well. So those sort of combination of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously Lings Cars meets all those criteria anyway, so it&#8217;s right in the sweet spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you haven&#8217;t come across the Lings Cars website, dear listener, please pause the podcast now. Just and Google it. Lings, L-I-N-G-S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:47] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> And actually, Lings Cars, has had a lot of people talking about it, because as a piece of design, it has some real. Like I was chatting to Tammie Lister about it the other day. People have written articles about Lings Cars, because it actually works as a piece of design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has enormous personality and there&#8217;s no other sites really like it, and it&#8217;s driving a lot of business to them. So, although I scoff about it, it is, as a piece of web design, it&#8217;s very effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s a full assault on the senses in every way, it really does demonstrate what&#8217;s possible on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:19] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> My accessibility friends don&#8217;t particularly think it&#8217;s great, but it has some issues on that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I would imagine. So, everybody that you&#8217;re putting against each other. There&#8217;s two people and there&#8217;s you sitting in the middle if you like, and they&#8217;re trying to do things as rapidly as possible. Now, presumably, a lot of muscle memory for them will come in, they&#8217;re just familiar with, okay, I can see that I need to lay out this, I need a sidebar here, and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you get to interrupt and say, wait, hang on, what happened just then? Or do you wait until the 30 minutes is up and then quiz them? Or are you allowed to say just repeat that little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:54] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I interrupt continually, &#8217;cause I think that&#8217;s quite interesting. And it puts more pressure on them. And we actually had Nick Diego on a few weeks ago, and he was at, he was answering questions from the live chat about what&#8217;s going on in core at the moment, which is just brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have this amazing idea that I think I&#8217;m going to introduce a bit more jeopardy. So halfway through the build, at some point I&#8217;m going to have a siren go off and it&#8217;s going to be a change spec request from the customer or something like that. We suddenly veer off in a different direction. Or the customer says, can you make the logo a little bit or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can you make it pop?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:25] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Can you make it pop? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Essentially we&#8217;re giggling about this because it feels like a lot of fun. And I do wonder, the reason that you&#8217;ve brought it into WordCamp Europe, do you have an opinion about that in terms of, do you think that the events could do with livening up a little bit? I mean we all talk about how wonderful WordCamps are. I think it&#8217;s fair to say that of us enjoy them when we go there. But do you think they could do with a little bit of excitement, drama, gimmicks, whatever the word is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:52] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, I mean it&#8217;s not just WordCamp. I think all live events, it&#8217;s like worth thinking about, what can you bring to that event that you can&#8217;t watch online, that you can&#8217;t get if you&#8217;re just sitting at home in your office? And I think events like this, you want to be in the room for an event like this, because there&#8217;s going to be audience participation. To be in the room is going to be a different experience than watching it on your computer screen, because you can watch the live streams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the more stuff we can bring that to WordCamps, because for me the real value of WordCamps is the people bit, you know, whether it&#8217;s inside or outside. And I think this is going to be highly interactive and fun. So I think, yeah, if we can do more stuff like this, which aren&#8217;t traditional kind of event type things, then that&#8217;d be great. That said, I have no idea how this is going to go. It might be a complete disaster, in which case, we&#8217;ll come back in a month and say, that was a really bad idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But you&#8217;re interested in filling up that room, and trying to get people involved. And, is it going to be a bit more pantomime than workshop? In other words, are you hoping that the crowd will, he&#8217;s behind you, that kind of thing? Are you hoping for people to be literally interjecting and yelling out, no, no, no, do it this way, that kind of thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:56] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. It&#8217;s been a fairly, because I pitched it in, I don&#8217;t know, about a month ago. So it&#8217;s been a fairly, we&#8217;re still working out some technical stuff with the technical team, but, yeah, there&#8217;s going to be music, I hope. And a big part of the online ones is that there&#8217;s a clock constantly ticking down, that people can see the whole 30 minutes, which just ramps up the pressure. So we need to have a big clock on stage and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But the technical aspects, so there&#8217;s going to be three people on the stage, your two contestants, for want of a better word, plus you. How is everybody going to be able to see what they&#8217;re doing? Are you going to have one big screen on one side, and one big screen on the other, showing what your two contestants are actually doing at that moment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:32] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> To be decided, at the moment. The backstop is that we do it the same way that I do it online, which is I&#8217;m kind of operating, and I&#8217;m flicking back and forth between the screens. So if we had one screen, it still works, because we can just flick back and forth between, so we can see what Rich is doing, and what Jessica is doing at different times. So ideally we&#8217;d have two screens, but I&#8217;m not sure at the moment whether that&#8217;s technically going to be possible. But we&#8217;ll see. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So just speak to the actual learning then, because obviously you started this, and it was a little bit of fun. But prior to clicking record, you&#8217;ve said that you&#8217;d had a few people on who did some fairly remarkable things. Not just in terms of the speed with which they could do it, but also presumably fairly creative. Have you managed to get actual learning out of it, not just purely entertainment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Do you mean me as a WordPress user?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, yeah. Do you feel like your audience are getting something, or does the format kind of lend itself more to entertainment and less to, I don&#8217;t know, introspection of what they were actually doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> There&#8217;s definitely more, if you&#8217;re going to have a pie chart, there&#8217;s definitely more entertainment than learning. The learning slice is relatively small, but there is a lot of learning. I was, watching, there was a great episode with Fabian and Kim Coleman, and they were incredibly quick, and a lot of that speed was through shortcuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I suddenly, in my personal WordPress usage, I&#8217;m now using a lot of shortcuts, and that has saved me a whole bunch of time. The last one was Justin Tadlock and Ben Ritner from Kadence, and they were building the Rolling Stone website. There was quite a lot of complexity in the grid layouts. A lot of people wouldn&#8217;t know that stuff, or the feedback I get, don&#8217;t know that stuff is possible, and so I think there&#8217;s loads of learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also loads of learning in terms of what&#8217;s possible in Core, and what&#8217;s possible in add-on plugins like Kadence. That was really interesting to see that direct comparison of Core can do this much, and it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s got a query loop block. But the Kadence query loop block is a lot more advanced. So if you really want to go advanced, then that&#8217;s an interesting comparison to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think there is lots of learning, and the feedback we get, because we do a washup after the half an hour is up, where we get the players to go into the front end and then the back end, and talk us through how they built it. I think that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What they also do is, they always say how they would&#8217;ve done it, not just how they did it, how they would&#8217;ve done it, or how they do it for clients. Because obviously there&#8217;s, nobody&#8217;s building sites in 30 minutes for clients. So there&#8217;s obviously a big gap between the way they do it on the show and the way they do it in their real life. So they&#8217;ll share that, you know, what they would&#8217;ve done, the purest way, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a bit like speed climbing, if you&#8217;ve ever watched that, where you&#8217;ve got the wall really, really, quickly, versus the purest sort of alpine climbing. It&#8217;s a bit like that. But there&#8217;s lots of value in a shorter format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, just being able to cram that in, and obviously get lots and lots done in a very short space of time, because you&#8217;re highly engaged and highly focused on it. And you&#8217;ve got the competition of beating your opponent. How has that all gone down? You know, because obviously you could get fairly, well, your ego could be wounded, let&#8217;s put it that way. You know, if you really reach a brick wall and you can&#8217;t figure out how to progress. Have you had any of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:20] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I mean, that&#8217;s one of the most amazing things. I&#8217;m completely in awe of everyone that comes on the show. Completely in awe, because we are having like 128 people watching live, you are a WordPress professional, and yet you are prepared to go on and give it a bash. I think that&#8217;s just an incredible, incredible thing to do. And so I come out and everyone&#8217;s done great so far. And even if they don&#8217;t do great, I think people are enthralled by watching people that will have a go. And the stuff they&#8217;re doing is just incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are people that like Ben Ritner&#8217;s the founder of Kadence. He&#8217;s got an incredibly successful business, and yet he&#8217;s coming on for 30 minutes of fun, and we are watching him build a site. And we&#8217;ve had lots of these people that are just the top of the game, like Nick Diego and Brian Coords, and Fabian, Kim, and a Rich Tabor this week. And Jonathan Jernigan, these people are like, these are serious WordPress people, and yet they&#8217;re prepared to come on, and be prepared to fail. Nobody has, but that&#8217;s an incredibly brave thing to do. So I&#8217;m completely in admiration of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you have a winner?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:15] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well, maybe I should do. I haven&#8217;t yet. That was the idea. So in the first few I kind of got the people in the live chat to vote, but a lot of them were just voting for the people they liked. It was a bit like a popularity contest. At the moment it&#8217;s not necessary, because it doesn&#8217;t feel like there is needing to be a winner at the moment. And that&#8217;s not really the idea of it, I don&#8217;t think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that said, I can definitely see where I have a day of, like a world championships of speed building, where there is a sponsor, and there is a prize, and it gets a little bit more competitive. To be honest, I&#8217;m just kind of feeling my way in the format. Some people say the format&#8217;s too short, and I understand that viewpoint. But it&#8217;s short deliberately, because it&#8217;s half an hour of people&#8217;s time. It&#8217;s half an hour of fun. And I don&#8217;t want it to be, you know, people&#8217;s time is precious, and I think it&#8217;s good to have time pressure. But the format may change a little bit, but I don&#8217;t foresee it changing a lot of moment. But yeah, no, there&#8217;s no real winners at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you think WordPress, the ecosystem of WordPress, and I know that you think about this rather a lot, you know, how WordPress pitches itself into the marketplace of website building, amongst commercial competitors like Wix and Squarespace. Do you think WordPress needs something like this? Does it need a bit of a shot in the arm to make it a bit more fun, interesting, entertaining? Do you feel like projects like this give WordPress a bit of a boost, in a way that it may not have had otherwise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:32] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Oh, I hope so. I do think about this a lot, too much probably. My view on WordPress is it&#8217;s this incredibly beautiful, radical idea that was started 21 years ago, and yet some of the content doesn&#8217;t reflect that always, especially when it&#8217;s compared to its competitors. It&#8217;s almost like, I don&#8217;t want to be too harsh, but some of the content&#8217;s almost like local government type content, in a way. It&#8217;s quite dry and technical. So yeah, I think that there is definitely a space to create some more entertaining type, fun content around WordPress, which has kind of been the rationales of my channel anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think also we&#8217;re living in an era where, and I don&#8217;t actually have any statistics about this, but it feels like the demographics are skewed towards older rather than younger, in adoption of WordPress. And I don&#8217;t know what the throughput is of teenagers coming in and being interested by it, but in a generation brought up on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, where entertainment really does directly lead to interest in certain things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can just point to my own children and see, absolutely, the straight line that&#8217;s gone from the mobile phone, the silly video that they&#8217;ve watched, into something that they&#8217;re curious about in the real world. We do need things like that because, well, we have to engage them where they are, and if WordPress as a platform wishes to continue, I suspect we are going to have to do more of these kind of entertaining, interesting, engaging pieces of content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:50] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I mean there&#8217;s a shocking stat, which is, because I&#8217;m in a YouTube mastermind group with a few people, and generally the female demographic on YouTube runs about 10% of our audiences. Now, mine&#8217;s just gone up to 20%. If you compare that to, my guess is if you compare that to Wix, or Canva, I know Canva is running about 50% female audience, definitely users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just from a purely kind of selfish market point of view, WordPress has a big, and I&#8217;m not talking about equality here, I&#8217;m just talking about if you were trying to reach a market, WordPress has some big challenges in terms of its aging demographic, and its male, female split for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So tell us when it&#8217;s happening, because I suspect a few people listening to this. We&#8217;re going to try to push this out. It&#8217;ll come out hopefully before the event, but let&#8217;s just imagine a worst case scenario, I fail to do that, and it comes out after the event. But nevertheless, tell us what day it&#8217;s on, and if you are in Turin or Torino for WordCamp Europe, when is it happening? What time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:44] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Okay, yep. So we&#8217;re on June the 14th at 5:00 PM, and we&#8217;re in track three, which is hall one. So please everyone, come along, pack out the room. It&#8217;s going to be loads of fun to finish the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If this ends up being really, really popular, you are going to be the one event that nobody wants to be in the speaker lineup at the same time as. It would be a little bit like if we put you on at the same time as Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s closing address. You can be fairly confident that the, you know, lots of people are going to go in that direction, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:12] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> If it okay as well, I&#8217;m hoping that they&#8217;ll invite me on all the WordCamps around the world, and this will be part of the, I mean, wouldn&#8217;t that be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Part of the gimmick, yeah. Part of the infrastructure. That would be really nice. Okay, Jamie, we&#8217;ve managed to get to about 22 or three minutes there.

You might know Jamie from his popular WordPress speed builds on that channel, where contestants have just 30 minutes to build a website from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we dive into Jamie’s involvement with WordCamp Europe, where he will be bringing this speed build format to the live stage. Contestants will race against the clock to recreate a pre-built website, all while being interrupted with questions from Jamie and the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie shares how this concept evolved from his own website recreations and how it quickly gained popularity within the WordPress community. He talks about the insights and feedback that both participants and viewers have gained from these speed builds, making it more than just a fun challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the technical aspects of the competition, including what tools and plugins are allowed, and how the time constraints add both pressure and excitement. Jamie discusses the importance of bringing more interactive and engaging content to WordCamp events, hoping to make them more dynamic and participatory in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we talk about how these speed builds can bring a fresh perspective to the WordPress community, potentially attracting a younger, more diverse audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re attending WordCamp Europe or you&#8217;re just curious about how WordPress can be made fun and engaging, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/\">Jamie&#8217;s plugin business</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/JamieMarsland/videos\">Jamie&#8217;s YouTube Channel</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/kadence-blocks/\">Kadence Blocks</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bricksbuilder.io/\">Bricks</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/\">Beaver Builder</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://elementor.com/\">Elementor</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lingscars.com/\">Lings Cars website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/gutenberg-speed-build-challenge/\">Gutenberg Speed Build Challenge: A Web Design Duel!</a> at WordCamp Europe 2024</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Gravatar: Maximize Engagement with Profile Page Design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=1496\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/05/user-profile-page-examples/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20310:\"<p>Everyone is unique, and our uniqueness is what makes the internet a great (admittedly, sometimes wild!) place. One way users can express individuality on your site is through profile pages, which gives them control over their online information and presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing user profiles for your websites or web apps, it&#8217;s important to create a clean and user-friendly design. Profile pages are the first point of interaction, setting the tone for the overall experience. A well-designed profile page enhances user satisfaction by providing easy navigation and interaction. It also boosts retention rates by making users feel valued and understood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s explore the important elements of a well-designed profile page, check out some examples, and see how <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> can make things easier!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Essential components of your website’s profile page design</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Profile picture or avatar</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"427\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Upload a profile picture\" class=\"wp-image-1499\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allowing users to upload a profile picture is the easiest and most basic way to start a profile page. A profile picture lets someone establish their identity on your website and helps users feel more connected to the platform and each other.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain consistency, provide guidelines for acceptable image sizes and resolutions. For example, a standard size of 400&#215;400 pixels at 72 DPI is usually sufficient. Ensure content is relevant and follows community standards. A reporting system can create a safe and respectful environment instead of approving profile pictures one by one. This method combines effective moderation with community empowerment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Name and username</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"428\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Insert your own name\" class=\"wp-image-1500\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Deciding whether to display the user&#8217;s real name, username, or both is an important aspect of profile page design. This decision impacts personal branding and privacy. For instance, using real names can enhance authenticity, which is beneficial for professional networking. On the other hand, usernames might be better for privacy, making them suitable for social or gaming communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Implement validation rules to make sure usernames are appropriate, unique, and memorable. Consider constraints like minimum and maximum character limits, prohibition of offensive terms, and the inclusion of alphanumeric characters only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Allow usernames like LucyMcMuppet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/274e.png\" alt=\"❎\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Prevent usernames like LucyXoXoMcMup&lt;3</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bio section</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"426\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Bio section \" class=\"wp-image-1501\" />\n\n\n\n<p>A bio section allows users to introduce themselves, share their interests, or provide a brief professional background. This section adds a personal touch and can be a great way to build connections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain consistency and readability, consider implementing character limits (e.g., 150-300 characters) and providing basic formatting options like bold or italic text. This ensures bios are concise and informative without overwhelming the reader.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interests or skills</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Including fields for users to list their interests, skills, or expertise enhances the social aspect of your platform by facilitating connections based on common interests. Implement a system that allows users to select from predefined categories or add custom tags to their profiles. This helps users express themselves and makes it easier for others to find and connect with them based on shared interests or skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Contact information</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"459\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-3.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Contact information button\" class=\"wp-image-1502\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allow users to provide contact information, such as an email address or social media handles, to enable communication and networking opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, users should be able to choose whether their email is visible to everyone, only to connections, or kept private. This flexibility helps users feel secure and in control of their information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Other design elements to make your user profile pages stand out</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating various elements can significantly enhance user experience and engagement when designing user profile pages. However, it&#8217;s important to note that these features are unnecessary for <em>every </em>profile template. Choosing to incorporate them depends on the specific kind of website you&#8217;re building and the level of interaction between users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Work information</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating sections for users to show their professional experience, skills, and achievements adds depth to user profiles. Features like timelines, bullet points, or multimedia elements make work history engaging and easy to read.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timelines help visualize career progression, while bullet points highlight skills and achievements succinctly. Multimedia elements, such as videos or project images, provide a richer context and make profiles more dynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Verified accounts and essential links</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving users the choice to show badges or indicators for verified accounts boosts credibility and trust. Verification can involve confirming emails or integrating with social media accounts. For instance, users can link their profile to their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/?lang=en\">X/Twitter</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning\">LinkedIn</a> accounts, which helps verify their identity through these established platforms. This assures other users of their authenticity and adds an extra level of security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a system for users to include significant links, such as personal websites, portfolios, or relevant external resources. Using icons or logos to represent various types of links or verified accounts ensures they are easily recognizable and visually appealing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Customization options</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customization options allow users to personalize the look and feel of their profile pages, increasing their sense of ownership and satisfaction. Let users choose color schemes, layouts, or background images while ensuring these options align with your website&#8217;s overall branding and design guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Multimedia elements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporate features that let users display their work, portfolios, or media files directly on their profile pages. This is particularly valuable for creative professionals who want to display their projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that these multimedia elements are optimized for fast display and loading times to maintain a smooth user experience. Use responsive design principles to ensure that multimedia content looks good on all devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Privacy and security settings</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/newsroom/press-kits/2022-norton-cyber-safety-insights-report-special-release-online-creeping/\">85% of adults</a> worldwide eager to take additional steps in protecting their online privacy, it’s important to ensure that settings are in place so users can control the visibility of their contact details. Implement granular privacy settings that enable users to control the visibility of their profile information to different user groups or the public.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow best practices for data security and privacy to protect user information. This includes using secure protocols for data transmission, regularly updating your security measures, and being transparent about data use policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Examples of websites with stunning user profile page design</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for some inspiration for beautifully designed user profiles, these websites are great examples. Let’s take a look so you can gather ideas to build a standout profile page template on your own platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gravatar</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"403\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-1503\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> is an online profile management system widely used by platforms like <a href=\"http://wordpress.com\">WordPress.com</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, and <a href=\"https://slack.com/intl/en-gb\">Slack</a>.

Seems simple enough, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if you’ve spent any time trying to make this work, you’ve discovered it’s not so simple. People have become quite familiar with filling out online forms. And, they’ve become more wary about giving away their information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Those two realities need to guide your thoughts and decisions about how to create and use lead generation forms on your website. People today are more suspicious about online activity than they were 15 years ago, and they are more demanding of what a “good” lead generation form will do and how it will&nbsp;work.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is, companies and website owners also have access to at least two decades of A/B testing data on thousands of websites, plus lots of real&#8209;world experience. So we’ve learned a few things, and there’s a robust body of knowledge about how to create high&#8209;converting lead generation forms. When implemented correctly, these tactics minimize the number of people who turn away for avoidable&nbsp;reasons.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, let’s look at 25 lead generation form best&nbsp;practices.</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283968\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1-keep-it-short-and simple\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Keep it short and&nbsp;simple</h2>\n\n\n<p>Short is good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And short applies to all aspects of the lead generation form. Fewer fields to fill out makes for a shorter form. Less text in the headline makes the form look shorter, and makes it easier to digest in a single glance. Shorter call-to-action buttons tend to work better than longer ones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there’s more to all of these aspects than just the length. Testing matters. The point here is, only include in your form what you need to include. Cut the excess. Trim the fat. Discard the non-essentials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>In other words, keep it simple. Short is good. Simple is better. Sometimes simple might mean a slightly longer lead generation form. But whatever results in the easiest possible user experience is probably the better way to&nbsp;go.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Use a benefit&#8209;oriented&nbsp;headline</h2>\n\n<p>The worst kinds of headlines on lead generation forms say some variation of&nbsp;this:</p>\n\n<p>“Join our newsletter!” The exclamation point isn’t going to make the difference&nbsp;here.</p>\n\n<p>In all seriousness, if the rest of your website is doing its job, some people will join your email list and fill out your forms even with a generic headline like this. But more people will respond if you write a headline on your form that provides a benefit for filling it&nbsp;out.</p>\n\n<p>Some companies hear this, and they change their headline to “Join our newsletter to stay updated,” or “Get the latest news — join our email&nbsp;list.”</p>\n\n<p>You can do&nbsp;better.</p>\n\n\n<p>What are the real benefits to filling out your form? Since most forms connect people to your email list, we’re using that as the example for most of these tips. But some forms have other purposes, like registering for a webinar, getting notified when a new product’s released, or becoming a member.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Whatever the purpose of your lead generation form, spell out a key benefit in the headline. Promise something your target audience will want. For&nbsp;example:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Stay ahead of the stock gurus when you join our&nbsp;newsletter</li>\n\n<li>Become a master gardener with weekly&nbsp;emails</li>\n\n\n<li>Get exclusive email-only deals&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>You can also include the benefit in the name of your newsletter. Give your email subscriber list a cool name that will resonate with your target audience. It’s no longer just your “email list” or “newsletter” anymore. Now, it’s The Market Leader’s Daily Tips, The Weekly Green Thumb, or the VIP Insider&nbsp;Track.</p>\n\n\n<p>Those are just quick examples, of course. You can probably do even better. But your target audience will respond more favorably and in greater numbers to a cleverly-named email list. It feels more unique, tailored to them, original, desirable, established, and credible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-include-a-clear-value proposition\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Include a clear value&nbsp;proposition</h2>\n\n\n<p>The value proposition is similar to a benefit, except now it’s one of your foundational attractions to your target customers and leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>You’re promising to solve a problem they care about, answer questions that matter to them, or deliver an outcome they desire, and you’re doing this by spelling out exactly what they get for filling out your&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n\n<p>One great way to do this is to offer something tangible in exchange for joining your email list. This could be a PDF like an eBook or a special report that delivers an instant reward of great value. It could be a special coupon or offer for new customers. Find something your target audience desires, and give it to them as a reward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also make a promise, without taking it too far. For example, Get Daily Writing Tips to Become a Best-Selling Author.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that example, the value proposition is right in the headline —&nbsp;it’s the thing that your target audience wants most.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>If it’s a webinar, specify that signing up reserves their spot, and include a core value proposition that the webinar will deliver. If it’s a free course, say when they have access to the course. If it’s a coupon, say when the coupon becomes active — “Sign up and save 20%&nbsp;instantly”.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Feature action&#8209;oriented&nbsp;language</h2>\n\n<p>If you look back over the examples from the previous sections, you’ll notice lots of active&nbsp;verbs:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sign up</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stay ahead</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Become</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You want your leads to do something, take action, seize the moment, grab the benefit, take a chance, be the first. Action-oriented language is more compelling, especially in your call-to-action buttons, but also in your headlines and subheadings if you use one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5-use-contrasting colors\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Use contrasting&nbsp;colors</h2>\n\n<p>So far, we’ve been talking mostly about the text and content, as well as the offer you’re making to your prospects when they fill out your lead generation&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n<p>But design matters, too. Contrasting colors get more attention than colors that blend in with the rest of your website. Online forms have become commonplace, and it’s very, very easy to gloss over them and not even notice. They blend in with the background noise we’re all used to&nbsp;seeing.</p>\n\n\n<p>Your lead generation forms need to stand out from the surrounding colors. You may have rarely used, but still approved, accent brand colors in your guidelines. This is the time to use them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6-avoid captcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Avoid&nbsp;CAPTCHA</h2>\n\n<p>CAPTCHA is a form&#8209;conversion destroyer. <a href=\"https://medium.com/rareview/why-your-captcha-is-killing-conversions-f9be6fe17d1f\">One study found</a> that an astonishing 30% of visitors abandon lead generation forms because of&nbsp;CAPTCHA.</p>\n\n\n<p>That’s serious short-term revenue if your lead generation tool incentivizes an immediate purchase. And it’s serious long-term revenue if your leads turn into repeat customers with high lifetime value.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is, you don’t want hordes of bots and scammers filling out your forms and gumming up your database with non-leads. That just annoys your sales team, when they first glance at the database and see 200 new leads, only to discover that 160 of them are spammers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>A better&nbsp;way?</p>\n\n<p>Use<a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\"> Akismet, a frictionless solution</a> that blocks spam form submissions using an ever&#8209;growing AI&#8209;guided database of IP addresses, email addresses, words, and names. To date, this powerful <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">alternative to CAPTCHA technology</a> has blocked over 500 billion spam submissions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-7.png\" alt=\"stats about Akismet spam\" class=\"wp-image-283970\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Plans are <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">competitively priced</a> (especially when you understand their instant positive impact on your bottom line) and Akismet also has an <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">enterprise version</a> for larger companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7-include-social proof\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Include social&nbsp;proof</h2>\n\n\n<p>Remember, you want to keep your lead generation forms short and simple. But you also want people to fill them out. Social proof is a powerful tool because it motivates and reassures at the same time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>For lead generation forms, the best testimonials will be short sentences, even just a few words or excerpts from longer ones. And as for placement, they work best near the call to action (CTA) button. Anyone hovering in that area has filled out the form and is now deciding whether to actually click the&nbsp;button.</p>\n\n\n<p>Effective social proof can help push them to take action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"8-add-trust signals\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Add trust&nbsp;signals</h2>\n\n\n<p>With so much spam and cybercrime, establishing trust online has become harder. There are some trust signals you can employ that reassure potential leads that you are a legitimate business or organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The most common trust signals include security certifications and noticeable privacy&nbsp;policies.</p>\n\n\n<p>A security certification is typically just the logo of whatever online security or malware protection service you might be using. Most such services include a logo as part of their service for exactly this reason, and because it serves as marketing for them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>And privacy policies serve as a confirmation that your company cares about the data of customers and leads. Few people will read your policy, so for most leads, the mere display of one accomplishes the goal of increasing trust in the reliability of your lead generation&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Ensure&nbsp;mobile&#8209;friendliness</h2>\n\n\n<p>By this point in the digital age, this should go without saying. But make sure your lead generation forms look right and function well on mobile devices. In addition, make sure the web pages on which they appear function, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>You need the lead gen form to show up on the mobile device in the appropriate place and at the appropriate time. It is a featured asset, not just background. It should not be possible to miss&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n\n<p>So make sure your forms show up and can be easily filled out and navigated on mobile devices.&nbsp; Test this. Once your form is up, get on a variety of mobile devices and see if it’s working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"10-minimize distractions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Minimize&nbsp;distractions</h2>\n\n\n<p>The form itself is a “content sanctuary.” Only vital and relevant text or imagery should be allowed in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the areas near your form should also be guarded closely. Busy websites with tons of features can be okay, but the form should not be buried in the midst of other content and widgets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you may have sections on your website with testimonials, screenshots, videos, photos, and text boxes. You might be using tables to compare the features of your various plans and products.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are not the place for your lead generation forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The form needs to break the flow of whatever else is on the web page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a sidebar, don’t make the form just one of many things on the sidebar. Make it the only thing, at least in that section of the sidebar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to put forms in the middle of blog articles and web pages, don’t wrap the text around the form. Make the form the featured and centered item wherever it appears.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is — make it impossible to miss. Yes, some visitors and potential leads will ignore your forms, but at least make sure they’ll see them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"11-use-descriptive labels\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Use descriptive&nbsp;labels</h2>\n\n\n<p>Make sure the labels for your form fields are clear and accurate. ‘First name’ is probably better than ‘First’, for example.&nbsp; Yes, most people know what the single word means, but you have to remember that the internet is for everyone. You have people from all sorts of educational backgrounds, all languages, and countries all over the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Your target audience plays a role in this, of course, but when in doubt, it’s best to be clear and not invite any confusion or uncertainty into the process of filling out lead generation&nbsp;forms.</p>\n\n\n<p>And make sure it’s clear which label applies to which field. It’s better to put the label next to the form field, rather than above or below it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Utilize a single&#8209;column&nbsp;layout</h2>\n\n<p>It’s been generally accepted for a while that single&#8209;column forms work better than two&#8209;column forms.<a href=\"https://www.foxit.com/blog/elements-of-good-form-design-single-column-beats-multi-column-forms/\"> Studies like this one</a> have found that single&#8209;column forms get completed much faster. Quicker form completion implies higher&nbsp;conversions.</p>\n\n<p>So, when in doubt, use single column&nbsp;forms.</p>\n\n\n<p>However, just about any lead generation form best practice needs to be taken with this caveat: Test everything to be sure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example,<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/one-vs-two-column-form-conversion-test\"> this HubSpot study</a> details their own experience with switching to a two-column form. When they tested it, the two-column version got higher conversions. But the likely reason for this is that their form is quite long.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The single column version looks much longer and thus probably intimidated more people from filling it out. The two&#8209;column one can be more easily seen in its entirety. With shorter forms, single&#8209;column should outperform two&#8209;column almost every&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<p>However, on mobile devices, two&#8209;column forms are more difficult to make work because of spacing, so your form needs to be well&#8209;designed and tested for all screen formats. Interestingly, Hubspot later altered their form to include elements of both one and two&#8209;column&nbsp;formats.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"13-minimize-mandatory fields\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. Minimize mandatory&nbsp;fields</h2>\n\n\n<p>Every lead generation form has a purpose. If you’re just collecting email addresses and trying to build your list, you don’t need very many forms&nbsp;because you can collect more information about your subscribers through additional marketing offers. You can qualify leads over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other companies prefer to get more information up front to save themselves the trouble of having huge lists with mostly unprofitable leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In either situation, you want to try to minimize the number of mandatory fields. What do you really need to know, and what would it be nice to know? For the nice to know stuff, you might keep the field in your form, but consider making it non-mandatory. That way, leads who want to quickly move through your form can do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, do you need a last name? In some cases you do, but in many, you don’t. It might be nice to have, but it’s definitely asking more of a lead to divulge that information than just their first name. Do you really need a country or a city? Do you really need both a home and work phone number?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reduce your form fields, and your form will get filled out by more leads because it will be less intimidating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"14-avoid dropdowns\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. Avoid&nbsp;dropdowns</h2>\n\n\n<p>Dropdown menus have a host of problems, which have been exposed through a<a href=\"https://baymard.com/blog/drop-down-usability\"> series of studies</a> on the topic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With long dropdown menus, such as country selections, you can’t see all the options, and it can be difficult to scroll through the list since every device works differently. The experience often frustrates users, and they end up skipping it altogether.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>With short dropdown menus, the question becomes, why not just offer radio buttons&nbsp;instead?</p>\n\n<p>You can see all the choices and just pick the one you want. On a mobile device in particular, dropdowns are much more difficult to navigate than simple radio&nbsp;choices.</p>\n\n\n<p>And for countries, the study recommends just using an autocomplete field. As the user begins typing their country, possible matches will quickly narrow down to the obvious choice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Dropdown menus are distracting, hard to navigate, and reduce the quality of the user experience. None of that can be good for your conversion&nbsp;rate.</p>\n\n<p>Opt for radio buttons, checkboxes, autocomplete fields, or just leaving that field off your&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"15-use-inline validation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">15. Use inline&nbsp;validation</h2>\n\n\n<p>This is a surefire winner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inline validation isn’t a very appealing term, but it definitely does wonders for your conversion rates. Why? Because it shortens completion time, increases information accuracy, and makes your leads happier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zuko.io/blog/inline-validation-in-online-forms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">One study</a> of inline validation found a 22% decrease in form field errors, a 31% increase in satisfaction, and a 42% drop in completion times, among other benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>What is inline&nbsp;validation?</p>\n\n\n<p>It’s a tool that detects if information a user has entered is probably incorrect. For example, putting two @ symbols in your email address, or a phone number with an extra digit can be detected by inline validation software. A note shows up in the form, telling the user they may have made a mistake.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>You can see why this would reduce errors, but why does it decrease completion&nbsp;time?</p>\n\n<p>Because the alternative form of validation is to wait until the form is all filled out, and then hit them with a bunch of red marks pointing out the fields that aren’t correct. Now, they have to revisit them all, which takes much more time, and is a frustrating experience that brings back memories of red ink in your&nbsp;schoolwork.</p>\n\n\n<p>Plus, if you’re using multistep forms, having to go back several steps to correct errors is cumbersome and frustrating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Inline validation eliminates most of these problems, making the whole experience of completing a web form easier and better for&nbsp;everyone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"16-activate autofill\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">16. Activate&nbsp;autofill</h2>\n\n\n<p>This was mentioned earlier, but it qualifies as its own lead generation form best practice. The reason is again because of the time it saves the user. Autofill lets you input common information that shows up frequently or is associated with other information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>If the user is new to the website, you can still autofill things like the email mailbox such as ‘yahoo.com.’ Once they type in the @ and the ‘ya’, you know what the rest will likely be. Autofill accelerates the process for fields with characteristics like this. And it can even work for fields with information unique to your&nbsp;website.</p>\n\n\n<p>For instance, a form could ask its leads what kind of car they drive. There are only so many makes and models, and autofill can accelerate the process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Autofill can also work for visitors who have been to your site before (or have stored, and allow access to, certain information saved in their browser). It can fill in their information, such as cities, zip codes, and phone numbers, saving them lots of time tediously filling these out again and again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Autofill will speed up form completion, and it will also increase form conversion&nbsp;rates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"17-use-progress indicators\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">17. Use progress&nbsp;indicators</h2>\n\n\n<p>Especially for multistep forms, the progress indicator bar across the top of the form builds momentum for the user as they see it get closer and closer to the other side. Humans like closure. We like finishing things. It feels faster when you can see the visual effect of your progress reacting in real-time to what you’re doing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1474\" height=\"1318\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-8.png\" alt=\"example of progress bars\" class=\"wp-image-283971\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Users think, “I’m already this far along, no reason to quit now”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"18-switch-to-multistep-forms-for-longer processes\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">18. Switch to multistep forms for longer&nbsp;processes</h2>\n\n\n<p>We’ve brought up multistep forms a few times already. For longer forms, especially combined with progress bars, this approach tends to work much better because it simplifies the experience of filling out a form by breaking it down into manageable steps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of a form with 20 fields, the user can fill out five smaller forms with just four fields each. It’s much less intimidating because each step requires just a few items. And with the progress bar, the whole experience feels faster than if you had to do it all in one form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Plus, with mobile devices, you can’t even see the entire form on your screen if it’s too long. That makes it even harder to tell how much more you have to do. And the scrolling invites usability frustrations. But with a multistep form on mobile, you can see the entire form for each step, the whole way&nbsp;through.</p>\n\n\n<p>One site<a href=\"https://instapage.com/blog/multi-step-form-part-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> discussed here</a> increased its conversion rate from 11% to 46% when they switched from a single form to a multistep form. If you have a long lead generation form, that ought to get your attention and motivate you to make this change immediately.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"19-highlight-the-benefit-in-the cta\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">19. Highlight the benefit in the&nbsp;CTA</h2>\n\n\n<p>Returning to your lead generation form copy, the text you use for the CTA button should be carefully chosen. Don’t settle for bland and overused calls to action like “submit”, “join now”, or “subscribe today!” Again, the exclamation point doesn’t help such a cliché CTA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your lead generation form is making a promise and asking people to do something — reveal personal information and enter your circle of influence. They’re opting in to receive marketing from you, and they know it. That’s not a small thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With action-oriented, benefit-focused CTA button copy, you can make them feel great about the decision to click that button and engage with your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The earlier tip about action&#8209;oriented language applies here too, except with buttons — try to keep the text brief. You can also personalize the button text with first person language, so the reader puts themselves in the situation. Here are some examples of great CTA button&nbsp;copy:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Get my free&nbsp;report</li>\n\n<li>I’m in! Send my VIP access&nbsp;code</li>\n\n<li>Grab your&nbsp;coupons</li>\n\n<li>Gain access to exclusive&nbsp;deals</li>\n\n<li>Stake my&nbsp;claim</li>\n\n<li>Start your subscription&nbsp;today</li></ul>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"20-incentivize-immediate action\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">20. Incentivize immediate&nbsp;action</h2>\n\n\n<p>Within your forms, either in the CTA button, the headline, the subhead if any, or perhaps a phrase right below the button, do what you can to add urgency to your form. So many website visitors never return again, so this is your only chance to capture most of the people who will see your lead generation forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no reason to be timid about it. Offer a limited time special, free bonus, or valuable promise. Use language like now, today, immediately, and right away. There’s no reason to wait&nbsp;because waiting will mean, most likely, never.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"21-ensure-form accessibility\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">21. Ensure form&nbsp;accessibility</h2>\n\n\n<p>Accessibility is all about ensuring that all potential leads, regardless of any impairments or cognitive differences, can interact with your form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, there are far more people with some sort of visual impairment than you may realize. About<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2800246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> a quarter of U.S. adults</a> over the age of 71 have some sort of impairment. In many of these cases, text on screen becomes harder to read or colors may blend together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So ensure your forms work with screen readers. Consult color contrast guides and make sure your page complies. Enlarge the text on your page, label form fields appropriately, and use helpful alt text.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, look to <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the WCAG</a> for accessibility guidelines that aim for everyone to use your site to its full potential and become a quality lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"22-boost-page-load times\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">22. Boost page load&nbsp;times</h2>\n\n\n<p>Improving page speed always helps website engagement, including with your lead generation forms. The longer it takes for your pages to load, the more people will abandon the site. And mobile tends to be slower than desktop for many sites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use a tool like<a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Page Speed Insights</a> to find out what you can do to speed up your website, for both desktop and mobile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"823\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-9.png\" alt=\"Jetpack Boost homepage\" class=\"wp-image-283972\" />\n\n\n<p>WordPress sites can turn to <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/boost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jetpack Boost</a> for near instant performance analysis and automatic&nbsp;improvements.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">23. Offer real&#8209;time assistance via live&nbsp;chat</h2>\n\n<p>For website visitors who get stuck on some part of your form but are motivated to fill it out, having a live chat service can bridge the gap and be the difference between a potential lead filling out your form or walking&nbsp;away.</p>\n\n<p>If you have high website traffic, a service like this could make a big impact on your form conversion&nbsp;rates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"24-optimize-the-confirmation page\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">24. Optimize the confirmation&nbsp;page</h2>\n\n<p>So far, everything you’ve seen here has involved the lead generation form itself. But lead generation doesn’t stop once someone fills out your form. That’s just the beginning. If you burn them out or turn them off the next day, no one&nbsp;benefits.</p>\n\n\n<p>You want to continue to deliver an excellent user experience from the moment the person has filled out your form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>It begins on the confirmation page. After a new lead has filled out your form, sustain the momentum by putting a lot of thought into the confirmation page. Too many lead generation forms just leave the default text in place, which is&nbsp;usually….awful.</p>\n\n<p>Switch that out for something better. A few&nbsp;suggestions:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Thank them! This should be impossible to miss, right at the top of the confirmation&nbsp;page</li>\n\n<li>Reinforce the decision they just made to join your list by restating the benefit or promise they will&nbsp;receive</li>\n\n<li>Give any instructions they need to claim their benefit, get started, or take the next&nbsp;step</li>\n\n<li>Consider including an upsell right here and turn your new lead into a&nbsp;customer</li>\n\n<li>Include a link that takes them somewhere else on your site to keep them&nbsp;engaged</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you offered a lead magnet of some sort, that should be featured prominently on your confirmation page. This is often the thing they want most, and it’s the main reason they joined or filled out your form. So don’t hide it. Don’t make them click through a bunch of hoops to get it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to offer upsells or other options for things to do next, that’s fine, but make sure they get what they want without any hassle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"25-follow-up promptly\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">25. Follow up&nbsp;promptly</h2>\n\n\n<p>After the new lead has completed your form and gotten past your confirmation page, keep them engaged and continue to build on your new momentum.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should be sending out an automated welcome email that thanks them again and gives more information about whatever they just signed up for. You could also send a welcome series, which can introduce them more to your brand, point them to other products and services, give them a sense of your brand voice and personality, and make them feel part of a community if that’s relevant to your form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use SMS in a similar way, as long as you get explicit permission to use this channel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you got their mailing address, you could also ship them something, even as simple as a thank you card. Again, the more they feel wanted, respected, and valuable, and the more you deliver on what you promised, the happier they’ll be to continue receiving your marketing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>For higher&#8209;priced lead generation processes, you might consider a follow&#8209;up phone call to new leads. Email and SMS are great, but if you’re selling high&#8209;ticket items, the more personal you can get, the&nbsp;better.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"examples-of-great-lead-generation-forms-in action\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples of great lead generation forms in&nbsp;action</h2>\n\n<p>A few forms that employ the lead generation form best practices you’ve just read about are on display&nbsp;below.</p>\n\n\n<p>Use these lead generation form examples to inspire you to spruce up your forms and increase your conversion rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1536\" height=\"936\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-10.png\" alt=\"example of lead gen forms from Empire Flippers\" class=\"wp-image-283973\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.responsify.com/multi-step-form-conversion-rate-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Empire Flippers</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>This multistep form from Empire Flippers uses a progress bar and inline validation to increase completion rates and reduce errors. It also features some credibility statistics at the bottom of the form, serving as trust signals that this is a reputable company that delivers&nbsp;results.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"833\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-11.png\" alt=\"short, concise contact form example\" class=\"wp-image-283974\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.samvanderwielen.com/legal-workshop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sam Vanderwielen</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This form is short and simple, and uses all the copywriting best practices discussed earlier. It has a benefit-oriented value proposition and headline, offers a lead magnet in the form of an online course, and uses a personalized CTA button. The button copy could be better though — something like ‘Join the Course’ or ‘Show Me How’ would work better. It also uses descriptive labels and makes the phone number optional.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>It also avoids CAPTCHA, eliminating that potential conversion&nbsp;destroyer.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"827\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-12.png\" alt=\"CTA for a free kitchen garden planning guide\" class=\"wp-image-283976\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://urbantaproots.com/product/gardencoachingpackage/\">Urban Taproots</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This form collects leads for a gardening coach, and offers a free 24-page kitchen garden planning guide. The form even lists four desirable elements of the guide, and includes a nice cover image. The headline uses action-oriented language. The CTA button isn’t benefit-oriented, but it is specific to what will happen when you click it. And the form is just about as short as you can get, asking only for a first name and email.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked&nbsp;questions</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-common-mistakes-when-creating-a-lead-generation form\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are common mistakes when creating a lead generation&nbsp;form?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Many websites include too many fields, and make too many of them required when they could be optional. Other mistakes include making the form too long when a multistep form could simplify it, using CAPTCHA, using ineffective dry language, burying the form, so most website visitors overlook it, and having ineffective or non-existent follow-up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"should-i-use-captcha-to-protect-my-form-from spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Should I use CAPTCHA to protect my form from&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>No. CAPTCHA has been shown to negatively impact form conversion rates. CAPTCHA adds frustration to the form completion process and lowers conversions by&nbsp;3.2%.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-akismet-and-how-can-it-improve-my-lead-generation-form-conversion rate\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Akismet, and how can it improve my lead generation form conversion&nbsp;rate?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet offers a frictionless approach to protecting your forms from being filled out by spammers and bots. It blocks IP addresses, email addresses, and names known to be associated with spammers using a continually&#8209;growing database and AI&nbsp;analysis.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-types-of-companies-generally-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What types of companies generally use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is used by companies of all sizes, from small businesses to large multinational corporations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-ideal-number-of-fields-for-a-lead-generation form\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the ideal number of fields for a lead generation&nbsp;form?</h3>\n\n\n<p>There is no ideal number of fields. It depends on the purpose of your form, the type and quality of leads you are attracting, your target audience, the price point of your products and services, and more. The general rule is to use as few fields as you need, and keep the non-essential ones optional.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-placement-of-a-lead-generation-form-affect-its performance\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does the placement of a lead generation form affect its&nbsp;performance?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Your form needs to be visible and impossible to overlook. It should not be placed too close to other items that will clutter up the experience and make it easy to miss. You can place it on the page in multiple locations such as at the top, on a sidebar, in the middle, or at the bottom. You can also feature multiple CTA buttons that all link to the same form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"can-the-design-of-a-lead-generation-form-impact-user engagement\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can the design of a lead generation form impact user&nbsp;engagement?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, forms that have poor color contrast, unclearly labeled form fields, poorly sized buttons, and too much clutter can make them harder to engage with. Plus, features like dropdown menus and two&#8209;column forms can make it harder to complete a form, especially on mobile&nbsp;devices.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-types-of-questions-should-be-avoided-in-a-lead-generation form\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What types of questions should be avoided in a lead generation&nbsp;form?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Avoid questions asking anything you don’t really need to know at this point in the lead generation process. Unless you need it to qualify leads at the very beginning of the process, leave those questions for later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-can-ab-testing-improve-the-effectiveness-of-lead-generation forms\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can A/B testing improve the effectiveness of lead generation&nbsp;forms?</h3>\n\n<p>As long as your website gets enough traffic to conduct a statistically valid A/B test, this is the best way to determine which form features and details are most effective on your website, with your target market. Simply create two forms that are different in just one key detail, make it, so each one shows up during the testing phase, and see which one gets higher conversion rates. Then, take the winner, change another aspect of it, and run another test to continue improving the&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-strategies-can-be-employed-to-reduce-form abandonment\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What strategies can be employed to reduce form&nbsp;abandonment?</h3>\n\n<p>You can reduce form abandonment by using multistep forms, inline validation, autofill, single&#8209;column layout, progress bars, benefit&#8209;oriented language and headlines, an inspiring offer, and fewer&nbsp;fields.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-copy-text-on-and-around-the-form-affect conversions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does the copy (text) on and around the form affect&nbsp;conversions?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Good copy motivates leads to want whatever your lead generation form promises. All copy should point to the same place — fill out this form and get what you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The #1 anti&#8209;spam solution for businesses and&nbsp;marketers</h3>\n\n\n<p>Akismet helps your lead generation forms perform as they should, without spammers and bots ruining the party. Our frictionless software prevents spammers from filling out your forms and making you wade through hundreds or thousands of fake signups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it does this without requiring the use of any silly CAPTCHA puzzles that just annoy everyone and make your leads feel like you don’t want them to fill out your forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">Get Akismet</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Do The Woo Community: Exploring Web Accessibility Success and Strategies with Christian Behrends\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=83958\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://dothewoo.io/exploring-web-accessibility-success-and-strategies-with-christian-behrends/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43130:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-31 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-89248ed8db92699e88a1e21a2d550588\">This episode is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-30 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-5 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-27 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-9 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-26 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"1224\" height=\"1224\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hostinger_Vertical_Purple-e1668465093968.jpg?resize=1224%2C1224&ssl=1\" alt=\"Hostinger\" class=\"wp-image-73505\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-10\"><strong><a href=\"https://hostinger.com\">Hostinger</a></strong>: As a builder or an agency managing multiple sites, check out <strong>Hostinger</strong>.

Welcome to the Do the Woo Accessibility podcast. I&#8217;m here today with my co-host, Taeke, and our guest, Christian Behrends from WebDevTrust. My name is Anne Bovelett. I&#8217;m an accessibility advocate and specialist, and one of my goals in life has become to make accessibility accessible without fear. There are no stupid questions about accessibility, and we hope to give you this platform to ask all your questions and talk about your worries or your successes with accessible projects. I&#8217;d like to give the microphone to Taeke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Hey, great to be back. As Anne introduced me, my name&#8217;s Taeke Reijenga. I run a WordPress agency called Level Level, and on the side, we also run an e-learning platform called the Collective or the Accessibility Collective, with great courses for beginners to intermediate to advanced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though I&#8217;m not an accessibility expert, I see myself as an accessibility advocate. I find it a really important topic, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m co-hosting this podcast with Anne. Anne already mentioned our guest today, and I believe that you know Christian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Shall I then ask Christian who he is and what he does because I have no clue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yes, please. I&#8217;m really honored that Christian was willing to come onto the podcast today because he&#8217;s even busier than we are. Lucky us that he had time to join us today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Alright, Christian. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve met before, and probably there are some people in our audience who have no clue who you are and what you do. Could you introduce yourself a bit to me and our listeners?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />Sure. Well, thanks for having me. My name is Christian Behrends, and I&#8217;m an e-commerce expert. Since before e-commerce even existed, I thought I&#8217;m quite the dinosaur of the industry. I was educated in the early nineties in Germany as a data processing merchant. I graduated in &#8217;94 before the local chamber of commerce, and since then, I&#8217;ve been involved in commerce data processing and programming, building websites, and helping my clients with their online shops. I have an agency called WebDevTrust, which is a typical German company specializing in e-commerce. So I&#8217;m really excited to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Well, that&#8217;s intriguing already. I immediately have a couple of questions I want to ask you. So you mentioned a lot about e-commerce; you&#8217;re an e-commerce specialist. Can you tell us a bit about the type of projects you work on? I mean, e-commerce is quite a broad topic. What is the typical client that you serve with your agency?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />The typical client is a small to mid-sized business building their online shops with WooCommerce or a business registered to sell the online shops of their clients. We have the technical expertise for some agencies that do marketing and SEO, and these are our typical clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />And mainly based in Germany or all around the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />Mainly based in Germany.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Cool, thank you. And this is a podcast that&#8217;s all about accessibility, of course. Can you tell us a bit about the role of accessibility in the projects you work on? How do you see that or maybe your opinion on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />Accessibility is really important and it gets even more important every day because the internet is such an important infrastructure nowadays, and you don&#8217;t want to exclude anyone from that. We have built accessible sites for charities. We created a site in 2015 or &#8217;16, and it was really fun. And then it dawned on me how important this topic is because they have to bring handicapped people into work and education. It&#8217;s a real important topic and it was my first touchpoint with accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />And that was in 2015, you said? It seems such a hot topic right now, but I mean, of course, it&#8217;s necessary every day, I would say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />Yeah, it is. And now we are expecting the European Accessibility Act to hit us in 2025, so when it becomes law, it gets even more important for my clients that sell products online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />And your clients are typically within the subject of the law, like the turnover they make or the size of their company is big enough to be subject to the law?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />It depends. We have one client, our biggest e-commerce client, who definitely is, but there are some that are below the threshold for the law to catch them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Could you sketch a bit how that typically goes? Like a client onboards with you or reaches out? Could you tell a little bit about the process from onboarding to delivery and where in that process accessibility plays a role?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />This is really individual because our clients are very different. Usually, they come to us and say, we want to relaunch our online shop or our website, and then we&#8217;ll suggest to them that we should take privacy into consideration, accessibility, of course, and search engine optimization. Accessibility is always a topic we talk about, and depending on the client, they say, yeah, it&#8217;s important. Or they say, yeah, well, it&#8217;s not a priority, let&#8217;s do this later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />It&#8217;s not a priority, we&#8217;ll do it later. I&#8217;ve heard that way too many times recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />Or can we just do the small accessibility right now and invest more into it later on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Yeah, I&#8217;ve heard that one before. Can we work on the priorities first? Let&#8217;s touch on four or five items when it comes to accessibility and leave the others for later. That&#8217;s a potentially problematic take on how to deal with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />And sometimes they can&#8217;t even invest in accessibility because we have one little online shop selling classical music. They just don&#8217;t have the funds to do an accessibility relaunch right now. So funding is important too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, the funding is an interesting topic because there are EU-wide subsidies for that, but I never got really deep into that because subsidies and government funding is a real jungle. I really hope if anybody who is listening is very proficient in the funding process, I would gladly invite them to come onto our podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also funding initiatives in Germany for this, and I have read about funding in the US, but since we are currently in a very European setting here, I&#8217;d like to stick to the European stuff because I simply don&#8217;t know enough about the American stuff, which is also a very important part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then this is also a mountain that people need to climb, I think, for the smaller shops. The thing is for some shops, if you turn it around, if they are shortly before being in this category of 2 million turnover and 10 people working for them, it could also mean it pulls them into this group because it&#8217;s proven that making a web shop accessible pushes your conversions and your revenue like crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great use case for that is Tesco. I know I&#8217;m talking about that one every show, but it&#8217;s a great one. And I think Taeke you probably have some examples too. To segue into something else right now, of course, it&#8217;s Taeke and me hosting this show, and we talk about what we know and what we do, but we would really love to hear from others about their successful projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s great to highlight a cool project as an example, also helping others to show that accessibility does not mean that your website is going to be boring or less appealing or anything like that. Just to touch on a couple of the, well, in some cases, the expectations of what you end up with when you have an accessibility consultant take a look. I would say that&#8217;s really a myth and something we can easily debunk by showing some cool examples. It would be even better if some of our audience members would provide us with some cool examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />I know there are quite a few in our audience who could, so if you&#8217;re being hit up by a DM, why</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />That&#8217;d be great. Yeah. So I&#8217;m going to turn this around because you work with Christian. I mean, that is basically the link to how Christian got on the show today. Can you tell us a bit or the audience a bit about how you work together? Because I believe I read on the website of WebDevTrust that you work as a freelance or in the flexible pool of people around the agency? How does that typically work for you in the cooperation with an agency?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />It starts at a very good starting point at the beginning. So this is important for every agency to understand. As soon as you involve or even start thinking about a new project or a relaunch, the first thing you do is call your accessibility person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason for that is that you otherwise risk being like someone who builds a house and then realizes that you missed the stairs, a couple of doors, and windows, and maybe even forgot to place the roof, which is incredibly expensive to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Can be fixed, but it&#8217;s expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Can be fixed, but it&#8217;s very, very expensive. So that is just money lost. All the revenue that you are going to make more in your commercial project by being accessible is then, in the first years, out the window. Then Christian will usually ask me if it is a relaunch, &#8220;Can you take a look at the current project?&#8221; Often these are the kinds of people that first try. Can&#8217;t we make it a little bit accessible? Of course, this topic that we just had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />So would you perform an audit if it&#8217;s a relaunch or if there&#8217;s something existing? Would you start with a baseline audit to see what the current status is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yes. Usually, if the customer wants it, then Christian will tell me the customer wants an audit to see if the current website can be remediated. Then I will give it a global audit and send a proposal that says this is what the full audit is going to cost because it&#8217;s</p>\n\n\n\n<p>first a preliminary audit unless they are paying for the full audit. This has to be compartmentalized before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clarity is very important and usually accessibility is like a tsunami for these people. They don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s coming to them. The code, the design, the content, and then we start to break things down for them. So Christian will explain to the customer like, &#8220;Listen, you will get some guidance whether you&#8217;re rebuilding or remediating. You will get guidance in your team on how to make sure that your content is accessible, your texts, all the stuff that you as a customer can actually influence yourself directly,&#8221; because Christian and his team, the tech team, are taking care of everything under the hood, all the stuff that you as a user or end user can&#8217;t touch. We are breaking things down for them in easy-to-process chunks because we have to deal with designers who need to be calmed down about the changes to their design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, instead of calming people down, it is a great thing to motivate them and say, &#8220;This is a challenge. This is going to tickle your creative gland. I know you love the funky pink and the white and the stuff. Can you put them in supportive colors and change it like that?&#8221; Throughout the process, we stay in touch with the customer. I think it&#8217;s good for me to give the stick to Christian now because he can also shed some light on that because he gets my stuff on his desk where I say, &#8220;Okay, this is what I propose. This is what we do. This is how much it will cost.&#8221; Then he takes it from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />On my end, accessibility is just a part of the project. I have a feeling right now that my clients are a little burned by GDPR, where we were all like, &#8220;Oh, GDPR, we have to do the privacy now and we have to have a cookie banner and consent management.&#8221; Then GDPR came and nothing happened. Now I talk to them about accessibility, &#8220;Well in 2025 accessibility.&#8221; So for me, accessibility is one of the parts I&#8217;m selling. I&#8217;m consulting my clients to take care of it, and that&#8217;s the hard part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />In some cases, Christian can ask me and say, &#8220;Can you join the conversation?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />To help out and come up with examples and all that, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yes. Usually, I&#8217;m trying to come from, &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s the most important thing in this topic that is still very scary for a lot of people,&#8221; and to come from the positive to motivate the designer, but also the content creators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I saw a tweet from Chris Hinds from Equalize Digital, the people behind the fantastic accessibility checker plugin that you can install for free in your backend. It will guide you on accessible content. The question was about, &#8220;Hey, what do you do if you&#8217;ve given your advice? You&#8217;ve been paid, you&#8217;re expensive because you&#8217;re good at what you do, and you send in your report and then after a couple of months, you notice nobody did anything.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My response to that was it&#8217;s usually a matter of people still being afraid that they&#8217;re doing something wrong, and then they will sit back and not do anything because not doing anything means they can&#8217;t break anything. This is also, for when Christian and I work together, a part of the process where we keep coming back to the customer and say, &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s happening? Did you change this or that?&#8221; We reassure them about this. It&#8217;s included in the package. It&#8217;s not like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s my meter, I&#8217;m turning it back on again,&#8221; because this is part of the care package. Accessibility is not a one-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s also your portfolio. If you claim that you guided a company on the accessibility of their website or their project and then you look back half a year later or maybe even three months later to see that it&#8217;s full of mistakes and errors, whatnot, that has its effect on us. People that value accessibility and that are on the forefront or shouting about its importance, then people suddenly have to stick to hit you back and tell you, &#8220;Well, this project that you&#8217;ve been bragging about is not doing its job.&#8221; What triggered me was the comparison with the GDPR that Christian mentioned. I really feel the same and have the same fears. It was such a big thing all over Europe. Everybody was in a panic, especially in the last couple of months before the law kicked in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that case, we already knew for years with the European Accessibility Act, we knew for years that it was coming and it was the same with GDPR. Somehow, in the last two, three months before it kicked in, we were just running around like crazy, installing whatever plugin we could find or whatever little script that would fix everything or that would defer scripts from loading and whatnot. In some cases, we had clients that chose the easy way out and just blocked total access to the website unless you agreed with accepting cookies. Well, that was soon regarded as something that was not allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you see the dust kind of settles and then we start thinking about how to do this in a proper way. Bit by bit you saw it being accepted and that it got better, but what I really see and what I&#8217;m really worried about is the same panic in a year from now. Yeah, a year from now, we&#8217;re probably going to be in this tsunami of panic like, &#8220;Oh shit, I need to get my project fixed or I need something.&#8221; What is easier than to just follow for a little script that you pay $20 $30 per month and you install something that will magically fix your website. For me, that&#8217;s really something just to clarify, that does not exist. There is no easy solution like that where you just pay a monthly fee and everything is settled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why I find this such an important topic. I&#8217;m this podcast as well because I really want to warn people, get your act together, investigate the topic. It&#8217;s awareness first, educate yourself, read about it and then decide what steps are next. Do you need a consultant that&#8217;s going to help you? Is it stuff that you can fix yourself or is it in content? Where do you need help? That&#8217;s also where I already mentioned it. If you need help or you have questions, there are no stupid questions, so please just drop them on the website, social media, whatever, but please let us know. I see Christian, we have imagery as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />But yeah, that&#8217;d be great. What I really like to have is material to educate the editors because sometimes you tell them, yeah, you have to add alt text to the images and you have to put in readable headlines, but then you have a fluctuation, the editor or shop manager changes and it gets forgotten. So you need constantly some webinars or anything to educate them. That would be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Well, for that we have the A11y Collective. I know it&#8217;s a shameless, a shameless, shameless plug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />This is a bit of a shameless plug, but…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />But this is also one of the things I know this is for some people they&#8217;re like, &#8220;How do you keep shamelessly plugging your stuff?&#8221; But you know what? We are all people who work really, really hard to spread the word about accessibility. We&#8217;ve done this for a reason and on the A11y Collective, there are many courses that are there for free. You can look and it&#8217;s been made and it costs money to create these. Then the paid courses call me crazy, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re that expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />The aim of the A11y Collective or the accessibility collective is to make accessibility more accessible. What I was going to give Christian as a tip is go there and get your client or the copywriter or marketeer, whoever&#8217;s creating copy, make sure that they enroll in writing accessible content for the web, which kind of takes you through any aspect of creating content, whether it&#8217;s text, video, imagery, whatever, and how to deal with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />You can put this in the proposal actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />This is something that you can put in the proposal and your client pays for it. I have the luxury that I own both an agency. What we do with our clients is that we onboard them for free basically in this course. So we make sure that the editorial team gets signed up on the accessibility collective. That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s super valuable because we see projects where the foundation, the technical foundation, is really well, but then also the teams working with it feel responsible and they have the right material in hand. They have the right resources to fall back to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Speaking about plugging, if you come onto the show or you have a great course yourself, bring it on. Tell us because I know there are people out there who do great courses. In Germany, especially for the German market, we are still and always on the lookout for German content. Those big names in Germany. These people who rock accessibility at making it accessible. One of the things in Germany, for example, is we Dutch, we&#8217;re used to speaking English when we&#8217;re five. But in Germany, this is less common. I think the same thing happens to France and Italy and Spain, all these countries where content or television is dubbed. Basically, you really need to deliver the content in the native language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m shamelessly calling for people from all over the world. If you are in a country where your country&#8217;s language is much stronger in tech than the English language is and you know about resources, please share them with us because we would really like to make this a corner in our podcast. We&#8217;ll probably share them in the show notes as well to share this with everybody because it&#8217;s not that the entire world speaks English only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />That&#8217;d be great if we had German resources because Germany is quite special when it comes to e-commerce. We&#8217;ve got two WooCommerce plugins, especially for the German market, which are German market and Ized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that would be great if we could have German resources for accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah. Alright, so thank you so much, Christian. We&#8217;re going to hear more from you later in the show, but I would stay around, but I would like to move on to some news. It&#8217;s actually one of the events that I really look forward to every year that I had to miss because I managed to get myself into a hospital and I did survive that, but I really missed the global accessibility awareness day and I was really sad about it. It was on May 16, but from what I could read on social media, it went off like a rocket. I think Taeke has something to say about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Well, fortunately, you&#8217;re back from the hospital, you survived, and you seem pretty okay, you&#8217;re on a roll again. Yeah, it was every year you see this with Global Accessibility Awareness Day and it&#8217;s in the name already. We try to create awareness about web accessibility and it&#8217;s an exciting day. There is so much going on. There&#8217;s also too much going on. There&#8217;s no way to grasp everything. All the events that are created, hosted, usually show up on the website of the Global Accessibility Awareness Day. So that is a nice resource to go back and take a look. With the Accessibility Collective, we ran a campaign where you could decide the price of your course and for one day only. That was amazing. We had hundreds and hundreds of people purchasing courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Great, thank you. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />It was really up to our audience to decide the price they were willing to pay for those courses. I saw a couple of names that I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;ve been waiting for a couple of months and then they started shopping and filling up their cart. But always it&#8217;s really cool to see that in one day we managed to have 300 or 400 new students on the platform. What is new this year, what we did is that 20% of the proceeds of that campaign, we will donate it to Sense. Sense is a charity that supports everyone who is deaf, blind, or has complex disabilities. That&#8217;s actually something that&#8217;s on my agenda for today to make sure that the transfer is made and that we ping them on the donation that we made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />That&#8217;s wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Yeah, we felt like this should not be too commercial. There should be an angle of giving back and making sure that it&#8217;s not just about awareness, but there&#8217;s an action involved. That&#8217;s actually, I saw that all over social media that people are now voicing for Global Accessibility Action Day instead of Awareness Day. Instead of just talking about it, doing stuff and getting the ball rolling and making sure that more is done during the day instead of just talking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />We should do an accessibility hackathon, man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Next year, but we&#8217;ll have some time to organize that. Something I wanted to mention is a really great and valuable resource. TPGI put together a great list of webinars and videos that were created during Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Those are really from all over the world and provide you with hours and hours of accessibility knowledge. We&#8217;ll put it in the show notes, the link to that. Something that is maybe not too related to Global Accessibility Awareness Day but something I really wanted to point out is an initiative or a platform created or founded by Karl Groves, a big name in the accessibility industry, and he&#8217;s aiming to create an event platform that has accessibility as the main priority. That&#8217;s the main focus of that platform because I think we all know that there is no event platform that is fully accessible. It&#8217;s either hard to buy a ticket or…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />It would immediately become the highest converting event platform ever. Definitely. Sorry for barging in on you like that, but we all know this feeling, especially on mobile, right? You hear about this concert or about this event you want to go to, you&#8217;re totally wooed about that and then you go on your phone and it&#8217;s too difficult and you&#8217;re like, yeah, okay, I&#8217;ll do that later. Then you don&#8217;t buy the ticket. No one is coming to that event that runs into trouble like that. So making an accessible event platform is incredibly important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of demand for that and I think it&#8217;s something that we can also support. You can back the project through Indiegogo and we will share the link. We hope that if you have a couple of bucks to spare, you&#8217;ll help Karl create this platform in the coming year. Something I&#8217;m really excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Me too. Absolutely. Okay, do we have any more news that we should discuss today or otherwise? I would like to move on to the next point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />We had questions from the audience. There is quite some re-shares and retweets and whatnot on social media. Not too many questions, so please don&#8217;t feel shy. As I said before, there are no stupid questions. Even if the topic is new for you or you don&#8217;t feel like sharing your knowledge or lack of knowledge, for us, it&#8217;s really any question is a good question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, but Christian had a good one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Yeah, I was going to say, when preparing the show, Christian kind of came in with a question, so I&#8217;ll hand over the microphone to Christian and we&#8217;ll try to answer that question as best as we can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />Yeah, and as I mentioned, it&#8217;s quite difficult for me to get the client on board with accessibility and planning, therefore, with relaunches. So how do you usually go about selling accessibility to merchants that are mostly concerned with turnover?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Well, I think that is one of the most valuable questions when it comes to accessibility. How do you sell accessibility? How do you get more people on board with accessibility? Something that we find so important, but how do you convey that message? I&#8217;ll make an attempt at answering that and I&#8217;m sure Anne will interrupt wherever she feels she has something to add.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />I always interrupt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />That&#8217;s why. Which is totally fine. No, I run an agency as well and we made the choice at some point to not make accessibility sort of a tick box in our proposal. For us, it&#8217;s not something that you choose if you find it&#8217;s important or not. If you work with us, it&#8217;s important and we try to explain to our clients or potential clients that for us, this is equally important as security or privacy, but also like SEO is important. People don&#8217;t accept, or clients don&#8217;t accept, a website that cannot be found in search engines. They don&#8217;t accept a website that is, especially in e-commerce, prone to hacking or their data is not safe with you. So why would they accept a website that is not accessible? With that, leaving 20-30% of your potential audience basically out in the cold because that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re essentially doing if you have a website where you don&#8217;t focus and don&#8217;t think about accessibility. You basically disregard 20-30% of your potential audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you can make a little sum that usually helps. I call it the business case for accessibility. There&#8217;s a free course on the accessibility collective by the way that&#8217;s on that topic and just about that little sum that we make. If your average turnover is this much or the average order value is this much and you have so many people shopping and you have so many people on your website, then there&#8217;s a percentage that you could count as a missed opportunity. They just left because they could not order with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then there&#8217;s also mitigating risk. Some other people, the business case is about making sure that they can&#8217;t get sued. I&#8217;m sure that in some countries in Europe, people are more afraid of that than in others. We still have to see what happens with the European Accessibility Act. Every European country will act on their own when it comes to enforcing it. But I&#8217;m pretty sure that there&#8217;s going to be a couple of high profile names in the industry, in the e-commerce industry, that are going to face legal implications just to set an example and make sure that people do regard this as something important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a way of saving yourself some money. So it&#8217;s usually the business case, it&#8217;s usually about money. It&#8217;s like about getting more turnover or making sure that there&#8217;s no damage to your reputation, your brand reputation is not damaged. But if you run a big web shop and you have a call center, people helping out with orders or whatever, the more accessible a website is, the better people can navigate on their own, the better they will understand what message you convey. They will also mean that they don&#8217;t need your assistance that much. We have an example project in our portfolio where the call center after the relaunch received 37% fewer calls because people could just do it online on their own. So if you don&#8217;t translate that to full-time employees or you can probably use those employees to do other things instead of just answering the same questions over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s so many cases that can be made to help your potential client or your client to understand the importance of accessibility. I really recommend the business case web accessibility at the accessibility collective, something we&#8217;ll also share in the show notes. There&#8217;s plenty of arguments to make, but I also know that from an agency perspective, sometimes it&#8217;s a difficult conversation because when money is tight, it&#8217;s not the first thing that people think of. Great point. Thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Taeke, I think I can add something to that. One of the problems we as agencies all run into is the level that the person we talk to is on. Very often these people are not in the top level management. They are below, they are paid to keep the costs in check. So it is up to us to give them the tools and the ammunition to take it to their boss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we know a lot of companies use the 80-20 or 20-80 rule, like okay, if it&#8217;s 80% for which it&#8217;s fine and we miss out on</p>\n\n\n\n<p>20, but then I&#8217;m really bad at calculations. So I love my calculator and I just typed in, if someone says, &#8220;Yeah, my website is great, it&#8217;s doing 12 million per year on turnover,&#8221; I will say, &#8220;Well, how about knowing that you are missing out on 600,000 annual turnover at a minimum, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s the bare minimum, it&#8217;s only 5% and it&#8217;s so much more.&#8221; So I think we can also help people in companies to give them that ammunition because not all of us speak to the management directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />It&#8217;s not because we say so and that we make some on-the-fly calculations. This is backed by research. There&#8217;s great research. It&#8217;s called the Click Away Pound Survey that was done in Great Britain with a lot of small facts that you can use in this conversation. The amount of people that never come back when they see that your website is not fully accessible, they can&#8217;t complete a certain action. By being accessible or having an accessible website or shop, you also work on a really loyal audience, people that keep coming back because it&#8217;s a nice experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have an accessible experience, you&#8217;re not going to check next week if it&#8217;s better. You don&#8217;t come back next month, but you still have that money in your hand that&#8217;s burning. You want to spend it on something. Either you want to get rid of that money, but just for the feeling of spending it or you need something and you will buy it anyway at a shop that is accessible. So there&#8217;s also a competitive advantage that you should take into account. I hope we&#8217;ve provided you with some ammunition, Christian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />Indeed. That was really great. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />Thank you for telling me about your resources. I will definitely look into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Perfect. Anne, up to you to kind of finish and round up this episode, what do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, I think so. I think so. It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re at 45 minutes and I know myself, I get impatient listening to people no matter how much I like them or how much I like to listen to them because I am part of that group that often goes forgotten in accessibility. I&#8217;ve got ADHD on steroids. So to keep the attention of someone who has that is quite the feat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to ask anyone who is listening to join the conversation when it&#8217;s published on Do the Woo. There is a comment section, but you can also find us all on LinkedIn, whether it&#8217;s Taeke or me or even Christian. You can find us. Our links are there. Our stuff is in the show notes. We are very much looking forward to the next episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I would really love to hear about from you is what were your accessibility successes? I would normally have shared one from last month, but my last month was a bit bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Went to shite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Hey, I tried to keep things simple here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />I like to use some swear words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />I&#8217;m not good at keeping things civil. Everyone who hangs with me knows that by now, but I&#8217;m trying. I want again to give my thanks to BobWP for giving us this platform. I want to thank Christian with WebDevTrust for giving his time. I want to thank you, Taeke, for taking your time, especially both of you running big agencies with big jobs. It&#8217;s very time-consuming, so I&#8217;m absolutely thrilled that you both every time are there, talking with me for the podcast, Christian for me, with other stuff that we talk about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also want to thank the people who sponsored me. The company&#8217;s called Greyd. They pay for my time to do this. So I&#8217;m really, really happy that I get to do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Thank you, Anne. You don&#8217;t leave any room for you. Don&#8217;t even take a breath in between. But also thank you for having me as your co-host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />Yeah, thanks for having me. I learned a lot. This was a great talk for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Thank you. Yeah, you&#8217;re a joy to work with. In general, everyone who cares about accessibility. I&#8217;ve never met someone who cares about accessibility who is not a nice person. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taeke:<br />Thank you all. Thank you. You&#8217;ll probably hear more from us a month from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christian:<br />Thank you, Taeke. Thank you, Bob. Thank you, Anne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Thank you so much. Bye.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s <strong>Accessibility</strong> series on <strong><em>All Things WordPress and WooCommerce</em></strong>, hosts <strong>Anne</strong> and <strong>Taeke</strong> have a conversation on the importance of web accessibility with guest <strong>Christian Behrends from webdevtrust. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They emphasize that accessibility should not be an afterthought in web development, but rather a priority from the start. They also chat about the challenges of selling accessibility to clients, particularly those primarily concerned with turnover.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of Accessibility<br /></strong>Christian emphasizes the increasing importance of accessibility, especially with the upcoming European Accessibility Act. He shares his experiences working with charities and the significant impact of making sites accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges in Selling Accessibility<br /></strong>Christian discusses the challenges of convincing clients to prioritize accessibility, especially when budgets are tight. He notes a common reluctance to invest in accessibility unless required by law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Role of Funding<br /></strong>Anne mentions EU-wide subsidies and funding initiatives in Germany to support accessibility projects. She calls for experts in funding processes to join the podcast and share their knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Successful Projects and Examples<br /></strong>Anne and Taeke share success stories of accessible projects, highlighting the benefits such as increased conversions and revenue. They invite the audience to share their own success stories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Working Together<br /></strong>Anne and Christian explain their collaborative process, starting with an accessibility audit and breaking down the steps for clients. They emphasize the importance of involving accessibility experts early in the project to avoid costly fixes later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Education and Resources<br /></strong>Christian expresses a need for ongoing education for content editors. Anne and Taeke recommend resources like the Ally Collective, which offers free and paid courses on writing accessible content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Global Accessibility Awareness Day<br /></strong>Taeke shares highlights from Global Accessibility Awareness Day, mentioning their campaign and its success. They also discuss donating a portion of proceeds to Sense, a charity supporting individuals with complex disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Future Initiatives<br /></strong>Taeke suggests organizing an accessibility hackathon for the next Global Accessibility Awareness Day. They also mention Karl Groves’ initiative, Eventably, to create an accessible event platform, encouraging listeners to support it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Audience Engagement<br /></strong>Anne and Taeke encourage the audience to join the conversation, share their accessibility successes, and ask questions. They emphasize there are no stupid questions and provide multiple ways to get in touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/eventably/#/\"><strong>About Karl Groves Eventably</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.tpgi.com/global-accessibility-awareness-day-2024-on-demand-webinars-and-videos/\">Global Accessibility Awareness Day 2024: On Demand Webinars and Videos</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.a11y-collective.com/product/writing-accessible-content-for-the-web/\">Writing accessible content for the web</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://webdevtrust.com/\">webdevtrust</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-behrends-97968350/\">Christian on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 09:12:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.6 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17289\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/06/wordpress-6-6-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14081:\"<p>WordPress 6.6 Beta 1 is here!

Please follow the project&#8217;s responsible-disclosure practices detailed on this <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\">HackerOne page</a> and in this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/security/\">security white paper</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s coming to WordPress 6.6?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s second major release is about polish and finesse. Features that landed in the last few releases have new flexibility and smoother flows—and a few new tricks. And of course there are a few brand-new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data Views updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the groundwork for phase 3, Data Views get new and improved experience of working with information in the Site Editor. A new layout consolidates patterns and template parts, gets you to general management views in fewer clicks, and packs in a wide range of refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overrides in synced patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could keep a synced pattern‘s <em>look and feel</em> everywhere it appears—keeping it on brand—but have different <em>content</em> everywhere it appears?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, maybe you‘re building a pattern for recipes. Ideally, you want to keep the overall design of the recipe card consistent on every post that will have a recipe. But the recipe itself—the ingredients, the steps, special notes on technique—will be different every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And perhaps, in the future, other people might need to change the design of the recipe pattern. It would be nice to know they can do that, and that the content in existing recipes will stay right where it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In version 6.6, you can make all that happen, and overrides in synced patterns are the way you do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">See all the blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to now, when you had a block selected and then opened the block Inserter, you only saw the blocks you were allowed to add to your selected block. Where were all the others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 6.6, when you have a block selected, you get two lists. First, there&#8217;s the list of blocks you can insert at your selected block. Then you get a list with all the other blocks. So you can get an idea of what you can use in your selected block, and what other blocks you could use in another area. In fact, if you select a block from that second list, WordPress 6.6 will add it below your block, to use in whatever you build next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A new publish flow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 6.6 brings the post and site editors closer together than ever. So whether you’re writing for a post in the post editor or a page in the Site Editor, your experience will be about the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Style variations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If a block theme comes with style variations, 6.6 vastly expands your design options right out of the box, without installing or configuring a single thing. Because in 6.6, your theme  pulls the color palettes and typography style sets out of its installed variations to let you mix and match for a whole world of expanded creative expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Section styles </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you build themes? Now you can define style options for separate sections of multiple blocks, including inner blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then your users can apply those block style variations to entire groups of blocks, effectively creating branded sections they can curate across a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A note about CSS specificity</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it easier for your variations to override the global styles CSS, those styles now come wrapped in `:root`. That limits their specificity. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/61810\">For details, read the full discussion on GitHub.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A native Grid layout</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grid is a new variation for the Group block that lets you arrange the blocks inside it as a grid. If you&#8217;ve been using a plugin for this, now you can make your grids natively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Better pattern management in Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You heard right: You can do everything with patterns in Classic themes that you can in a block theme. You can see all the patterns available to you in a single view and insert a pattern on the fly. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Negative. Margins.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re here: negative margin values, so you can make objects overlap in your design. As a guardrail, you can only set a negative margin by typing an actual negative number, not by using the slider. That’s to keep people from adding negative values they didn&#8217;t intend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rollback auto-updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can have the convenience of setting all your plugins to auto-update and the inner peace you get from knowing that if anything goes wrong, 6.6 will do a rollback. Automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This post <strong><em>reflects the latest changes</em></strong> as of June 4, 2024.</em></strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Again, the features in this first beta

Woo DevChat, Zach as always. And I&#8217;m here with Carl Alexander, my tireless co-host who puts up with me every month. Carl, how are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Good. I&#8217;m good. It&#8217;s finally starting to warm up in Canada. We&#8217;ve gone through multiple fake springs where it seems like it&#8217;s going to be warm, but then it snows again. Then it&#8217;s warm again, and then it rains, drizzles, and hails. But now, it&#8217;s for real. Yesterday we had our first really hot day. I think it was over a hundred. It was like 37 Celsius, which I think is over a hundred Fahrenheit. I never know how to convert to Fahrenheit, but it was hot. It&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, it hasn&#8217;t gotten quite that hot here, but it&#8217;s been in the eighties, so quite warm for northern Illinois this time of year, which I&#8217;ve been very happy about as well. So I hear there&#8217;s a rumor swirling around that some people are trying to do another dev chat. Have you heard about this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I&#8217;ve had inklings; my little birdies have told me something is cooking. Bob is cooking something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />One of those birdies named Bob?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I should not tell you if it&#8217;s Bob or not, but it was Bob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s true. We don&#8217;t want to reveal our sources here. So yeah, I guess all of you like hearing Carl and I talk so much that we&#8217;ve decided to add another Woo DevChat that&#8217;s not Carl and I, which is pretty cool actually. But who&#8217;s going to be hosting this one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I think Bob would go crazy. He&#8217;d be like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t edit Carl twice a month. This is an unacceptable arrangement to me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I mean, I think at that point, even the AI that Descript uses to somewhat auto-edit would probably say no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />The AI would peace out. &#8220;You&#8217;re on your own, Bob.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s just enough. Bob, you&#8217;re going to have to go back to the Stone Age and use Audition to chop this up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I mean, that was the original Terminator script. The AI had to edit Carl, and they were like, &#8220;No more, no more. I&#8217;ve had it with humanity. We&#8217;re done.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />That seems pretty accurate. So I guess we should just drop some knowledge here. We have some guests today, and they may or may not be, I can&#8217;t confirm or deny, the hosts of this new Woo DevChat. Why don&#8217;t we start out with Mike? Mike, why don&#8217;t you introduce yourself? Carl is sitting there waiting to learn all about you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I&#8217;m Mike. I am a WordPress performance specialist and WooCommerce dude who runs a performance agency called WP Bullet. I&#8217;ve been working with this stuff for a long time. I&#8217;ve also been freelancing for a good six or seven years now, and I live right down the road from my buddy over here who&#8217;s up in the top right-hand corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />And that buddy, I know his name. I&#8217;ve met him before. I may have taken photographs of him in front of a giant well-used elephant at WordCamp US. And that would be Marcel. Marcel, why don&#8217;t you introduce yourself to everybody?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />That&#8217;s true. The famous photo. I have to replace that photo with my avatar photo they have everywhere. Hey everyone, my name is Marcel, a WooCommerce expert. I live in Porto, Portugal, just a couple of minutes away from Mike and our source Bob. I&#8217;ve been working with WordPress for more than 12 years, 13 years now, WooCommerce for eight years. I&#8217;m currently freelancing as well, for eight years now. I had an agency before that, I had multiple products coming out. Just happy to join, happy to be here, and we have a lot to talk about I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, so we&#8217;ve been doing the dev chats now for a little over a year, maybe a year and a half, I think. Bob could answer that. We&#8217;ve done quite a few of them and they seem to be pretty popular. People seem to be learning from the things we&#8217;re talking about. I think there&#8217;s a gap to fill to help people go from builder to developer. There are a lot of people who can build a WooCommerce site and understand how to use WooCommerce as a plugin, but the move to how to extend and optimize WooCommerce as a developer is really kind of a big shift. I think we&#8217;ve been trying to fill that gap and help people make that transition into understanding more of the internals of how WooCommerce works, understanding what things like high performance order storage mean, understanding how to write things that don&#8217;t, oh, I don&#8217;t know, break action scheduler. These are things we don&#8217;t want to do, and I think there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity for learning more from more voices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really glad that the two of you have decided to join us here and start to do some episodes as well. And I&#8217;m really interested to know what type of guests you&#8217;re planning on going after, what types of topics you want to talk about, what ideas you have in the hopper because one, we&#8217;d like to avoid those topics to give you room, but two, I think it would be really cool to kind of get a glimpse of the future for some of the people that are listening and really understand what the full package is now with what we&#8217;re going to be giving as the Woo DevChat moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />We have been talking about doing a podcast ourselves for a couple of years now. We’ve been meeting every now and then at a coffee shop, talking about development, talking about our work, and we suddenly realized we could eventually just press record on a mobile phone, put it on top of a table and just record ourselves talking about different subjects. Although that never left the phone storage and we never put that together into a proper podcast, the fact that Bob moved to Portugal and actually chose to live a couple of minutes away from me and literally seconds away from Mike just sparked our interest in doing a podcast together and talking about different subjects. We are both developers and we&#8217;ve been doing client work as freelancers for a good six, seven years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the topics we will cover can vary a lot. We don’t need to specifically restrain ourselves to the area of expertise that we talk about or that we mainly work in, which is WooCommerce. There’s so much to talk about, not only the development part itself, the technical details and all the little tricks and tips that we can give, but also about client experience, what clients do with WooCommerce, and the challenges that those bring to the table. We have so many people that we know within our freelancer community within Codeable, as you well know, Zach, that could also come into episodes and talk about their experiences and their expertise. We have a couple of things figured out and we have a couple of experiments coming out. We also are planning on eventually doing some live podcasting, doing podcasting at events and having other people join as we record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, I think we&#8217;re going to be experimenting a bit in the beginning to see what works. We have a bunch of cool nerdy friends, so whoever we convince to come on and share their experience and what they&#8217;re working with and teach people whenever it is they’re working on, I think it would be fun. Marcel and I have a lot of experience speaking with clients, big clients, and the communication and managing expectations and getting them to understand and appreciate what I call invisible progress when they are refactoring something that&#8217;s going to take three or four months and it’s going to work exactly the same afterwards. That&#8217;s a difficult thing to try and sell to a client, for example, but it’s essential for the ongoing development of their project. It’s like redoing the foundation of a house and you&#8217;re like, well, my kitchen is still where it is. The toilet still works. Everything is still there, but it&#8217;s difficult. So I think we’d like to talk about some of these softer skills as well, which are essential developer skills nowadays, especially if you’re freelancing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />There was a meme of me a couple of years back, this guy in Montreal, named Michel. Maybe you’ve seen him, Mike, but he made a lot of gifs and memes of me. One was “Soft skills to pay the bills” with some Beastie Boys. I really believe that you need a lot of soft skills, especially if you’re on your own, but even in companies, I find it useful to have soft skills as a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />It’s amazing the power of language and the choice of words that you use can have a dramatic impact on the interaction you have with a customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, I mean it’s all communication. I always say I can charge an extra hundred dollars an hour because I answer emails. It’s crazy to me that people aren’t responsive and that it’s really mind boggling to me because that’s a really important part of interacting with people is just being responsive and feeling like they&#8217;re being heard and all that stuff. So it’s not just about the actual code itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, I was going to say you could add another hundred if the client can feel that you really, really care. You’re really invested in their success and their progress and growth as a company or as a human being and their mission, whatever it is. Once they know that they can trust you with that, they don’t want to let you go. It’s like any kind of relationship where they’re just like, oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you’re the person I want to take on this journey and you are going to help me be the pilot sometimes, sometimes you’ll be the engineer or whatever. It’s very special.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />And surprisingly enough, the easiest way to prove to customers that you care is to actually care. It’s amazing how that works. If you take a vested interest in their business and their success and you genuinely want to help them in that regard and it’s not just a paycheck at that point, you’re going to do better work. They’re going to be happier customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Exactly. And you’re also going to be more motivated to continue working with that client, right? Because you did this first work, they had success and you were proud of your work that you delivered. You made the client happy and maybe their business also succeeded a lot more, and then you go back again and do it again, and then you repeat it and repeat it. That’s just the joy in seeing those businesses grow because of some contribution that you made to it and even getting paid for the special work that you do. That’s all that matters. The way you communicate and the way you talk to the clients, they will notice that. If you get excited about a success or if you put in that extra hour because something doesn’t work and you want to make it work, and if you communicate out of the regular hours because you figured something out and fixed something on their side without their request, all of those little details add to the relationship and that’s what you as a developer should be able to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, it’s amazing how much better a relationship is when you show you genuinely care, respond promptly in the way that you would want to be responded to, and do good work. Those three things, for whatever reason, seem to be the recipe for success. Communicate well and timely and do good work, and you can keep customers very happy with just those three things. Even if you have to shift a deadline, if you’ve communicated well and established that you are never going to push a deadline unless you absolutely have to, and that the only thing that can change your timeline is the unknown unknowns, the things that you find during the process and you’ve set the stage for the possibility of that happening, and established how that happens if it does, you can shift a timeline without the customer getting angry about it. But you have to have set the stage, you have to have that relationship, the rapport with that person in order to be able to do that. So yeah, soft skills are absolutely important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably in some cases, especially on some of the larger, more enterprise clients, almost more important than your ability to deliver clean, elegant code. It doesn’t have to be clean and elegant if it works. In some cases, yes, obviously clean and elegant will be more maintainable and likely more performant, but what really matters is your ability to deliver something the client is happy with. And you do that via using those soft skills. So yeah, absolutely important. I’m excited to hear more of what the two of you have to say on that subject as new episodes come out. Knowing the two of you, being a Codeable expert myself, and seeing the work that we’ve all done there, I know that there will be some hard skills too that we’ll talk about and that all of us have faced unique challenges with WooCommerce. Those unique challenges have happened because we have been on the edge of what’s possible with WooCommerce numerous times. Some of us have even worked directly on the product. So just lots and lots of experience and knowledge around what these unique challenges could be, what things we’ve found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a big product. Getting into WooCommerce now compared to right after the fork, getting into it now is much harder. The mono repo is a jungle when you first get into it. That was a big shift, a big change. It made it harder, I think, for individual contributors to get into the code base and understand what’s going on. For those of you who aren’t familiar with what a mono repo is, it’s a giant repository that contains all of WooCommerce and everything related to it. It’s a much more complex project than it once was. All the plugins that were feature plugins that have been folded into the main repository have added layers of complexity, things like blocks, and other things that weren’t there before. So now it’s just a much more complex thing to understand. It’s not just PHP anymore, it’s PHP and React and all of these other things that have gone into building a better admin experience and doing all of the other things that they’ve done. It makes a more complicated product, so it takes more to get in and understand everything that’s happening. Action scheduler is part of WooCommerce itself now, instead of just being part of subscriptions, if you’re using subscriptions. There are many more things that have just become part of the project. I’m interested to hear your takes on how you feel about the mono repo after having it for a little while here and whether or not it increased your complexity the way it did for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />If you were to ask that question to me maybe one or two years ago, I would ask you back, “What is a monorepo?” WooCommerce taught me what a monorepo was because I’d heard about it, but I’d never seen it in practice. I immediately jumped out of it. Back in the day, you could just clone the repository, build it yourself, do a couple of experiments to figure out what things are under the hood and what happens if you change that code. Nowadays, for you to get to a certain point where you can compile and it will not fail or take five or six minutes to do the first compile, it’s just actually not possible. So it’s definitely harder to deal with it and to take a look at the features and how they work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, our challenges are also what is missing in WooCommerce for particular use cases, what could be different in a way that would fit certain needs. There are definitely some patterns that we see as we deal with different client projects that could eventually be changed, adapted, or somewhat adopted by WooCommerce as an out-of-the-box feature. That is already very interesting to see, and we’ve seen other features coming into the WooCommerce feature set as well. That’s also something I think we’re going to talk about: our experience adding those little things as extensions, as plugins, as little extras that people need to make WooCommerce adapt to their business model, but at the same time also taking out some features. There are so many things in there and people keep asking, “Why do you need all these 10 fields? I only need those two ones.” So we end up also taking features out of WooCommerce, which is an interesting topic as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />That is really cool. I actually didn’t know about the mono repository. I’ve never been inside of it. It sounds big and scary, but if you can literally compile your own WooCommerce that makes it leaner where you can sort of toggle pieces on and off, that sounds amazing. Is that what you’re saying you can do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Well, you could eventually do that, but it’s a lot more complicated right now to get it working. There are so many little details. If you look at the PHP classes right now, they do not tell by themselves what they’re actually responsible for because it’s just a tiny little thing that is connected to another one, which is connected to another one. You have 10 or 12 different ones that are responsible for a single change of a string. I’m probably exaggerating here, but it’s close to that. It’s harder to figure out where that filter or hook is to actually change something on the screen. Because you’re adding React on top of it, we now have triggers and filters going on the JavaScript side. So that’s the other side of the room, so to speak. It’s even more difficult to get your head around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It used to be the case where you could eventually figure out in your head, I think I have a grip on what things are. Right now, it’s just a complete jungle as you were saying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, I think that we could benefit from some guidance from the WooCommerce team on where certain things are located and best practices for extending them. Now in this new world where meta fields are harder to make and things are harder to do than they have been before. It used to be really easy to extend the admin screens because they were in PHP, but they’re not now. So how do we do that? How do we make those extensions? What are the best practices for adding things to the new product screen that’s coming? All of these pieces that are becoming more React-based over time and getting closer to the block editor as well. All of these things are changing, and it doesn’t seem like there’s a good path to learn how to do all the new things yet. This is a problem not just WooCommerce-related. It’s a problem across the board with a number of plugins that do updates to their admin and their front-end screens that are using more block and React-based things. It becomes harder to extend those things if you’re not considering how that extension will work, how the ability to extend will happen from the beginning. While we have had this ability as PHP developers to just modify how anything works in the WordPress ecosystem, that’s becoming less the case as things move further into React. It’s a very interesting topic to me trying to understand where we’re going and how to stay on the bus rather than fall off of it. For some people, it’s been a difficult thing to keep up with all of the changes over the last few</p>\n\n\n\n<p>years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Definitely, and it feels like in the first moments when React came into WooCommerce, everything was a little bit experimental. The team implementing all the alternatives for the cart and the checkout was figuring it out as they were releasing it. Some of the stuff that was not possible two years ago is now starting to be possible. So it feels to me that things are sort of being tried in a real world where people are adopting and giving feedback. As developers, we also have an important role in communicating our difficulties. There are different channels that we can use to explain why we think this shouldn’t be this way and how the alternatives could be set up. That is sort of changing. It’s still more on the experimental side. There are still some things that we like to keep locked because of reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP used to give us so much freedom that we don’t have right now with React, and I still think that there’s a lot that we can do to regain some of that freedom for changing stuff. So that’s something we can definitely talk about because we live that day to day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I have a lot of opinions on the React stuff. The whole topic for the last 10 plus minutes is about how this code base is really getting really complex. One of the topics even in the larger developer community is how do we keep things from spinning out of control? I feel like we all got the full site editor and everything’s great. I think it’s a really good feature. I feel WordPress used to be something that was a lot more approachable, and now the skill gap between starting and where you need to be to even understand these larger plugins or WordPress itself is starting to be even larger than it used to be. WordPress also is adding a lot of—WordPress loves reinventing the wheels—so there’s the reactivity API now. There are all things that exist with other libraries, but we’re reinventing them, so everybody has to relearn what to do with WordPress-specific things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everybody’s comfortable with JavaScript because they come from PHP. You used to just install a simple LAMP stack and then be off to go. Now you need build tools and the whole thing. So it’s a really different world. Sometimes I worry about developer experience with what I feel like is a recurring topic because for advanced developers, it’s okay, but a lot of WordPress developers aren’t advanced. It makes it very complicated for them to jump in and try to figure out what’s going on or how they can contribute. Even contributing back to a project becomes hard to even find anything to get yourself up to speed. That’s something that is on my mind a lot because I feel like that used to be a WordPress thing, and now I don’t feel it is. I don’t feel WordPress is that accessible anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Part of WordPress before was its accessibility from a coding perspective and publishing perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />From a developer perspective. How much code did you fix that was just some PHP code written straight in the file or something like that? You can’t do that now if you have blocks and things like that. It’s a lot harder, right? I mean, it’s a different world. One of the problems I find is tooling. I’ve been programming for so long, but just looking at where even the rest of the PHP ecosystem is, before it used to be like, oh, doing symphony and stuff like that, that’s hard. Now I feel like if I want to contribute to WordPress core, that’s way harder than making a patch for Laravel or for way harder. To me, that speaks to something about the project and the accessibility for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a bit of what’s been talked about. It’s like, oh, it’s a monorepo. Monorepos aren’t new. Symphony’s a monorepo. There are a lot of monorepos out there. The fact you can’t just arrive and know what you need to do. I don’t even try to be honest, but I don’t think it’s that easy to get yourself up and running the same way it is with a lot of these projects that are more focused on contributions and things like that. It’s a bit gatekeepery in some ways because if you want to get in and do it, it’s not always that simple now. I think developer accessibility is a thing now. I really don’t think WordPress is the easiest thing to use now or to contribute to or understand the way it used to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />No, I agree. Yeah, you brought up the interactivity API. Very interesting stuff. I hope that maybe at some point we get the cart fragment replaced with an interactivity API-based one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />But for me, it’s a question of, again, I’m a bit detached now, but why do we need this versus just using something like Alpine.js? Why do we need to add more things that we have to maintain?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />No, I agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Before, they used to be a bit more open to that, like the backbone, and they even put some PHP libraries in there. Now it’s a lot of reinventing the wheel. That’s also more complicated, right? Because now there’s no analog. If you’re like, oh, okay, WordPress uses Alpine.js, I can go to the Alpine.js documentation. Now, there’s just the reactivity documentation. You either know how that works or you don’t. There’s nobody else using this, it’s just here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like that I think a lot about because, for me, I’m always thinking about the health of the project. That’s been on my mind a lot in the past year or so. How do you bring new people in? The more you make it your own thing with no analogs anywhere else, and you make it complicated, it’s hard to onboard new developers. They’re going to be like, screw this, I’m going to go do Next.js or some other thing. There’s a million documentation and it’s easier to get started. I think a lot about that. I think WooCommerce suffers also from that. I think it’s a really hard project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not WooCommerce’s fault. E-commerce is freaking hard. Nobody that looked at the Magento code base was like, oh yeah, this is super easy. E-commerce is hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />E-commerce is a competition, so all the platforms are competing against themselves. The feature that comes into one platform needs to be integrated very quickly in the other one. So everybody’s competing for the next biggest feature and thing, so that adds to it. You were talking about Alpine and other stuff. It used to be the case that, oh, I used Alpine for other projects rather than WordPress, and I know a little bit about this, or I’ve used this other tool for other things. Now you learn about languages and markup that are uniquely exclusive to WordPress that you cannot use anywhere else. So what’s the incentive?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />That’s true too. Yeah, all the markup too. That’s a really good point. All the markup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />What are you going to do with that markup outside of WordPress? So you’re investing all of this time just for this specific platform. That was not something that used to be the case back then as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, no, I love the markup. That’s a really good point. Just all the output that the block editor does is not reusable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />And it’s hard to learn. You’re not going to be able to write a markup without actually rendering a block, seeing what the outcome is, and just copy-pasting whatever. You need to reuse that. That’s not something that you just type as a programmer into language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />No, no, exactly. That’s on my mind a lot because I think about the health of the project, and the health of a project is people joining. It’s not just being old farts that have been here for a decade plus, like me and Zach. I think you all have been there for close to a decade or over a decade, so you need new people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s cool to make it sexy, but also if you make it non-comparable to anything else, there are no transposable skills, so you have to be a really good developer, which wasn’t also what WordPress was about. A lot of people learned programming through WordPress. Now again, same thing. I think it’d be really hard to learn programming through WordPress now because of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />It sounds like a lot of overhead, and that’s a barrier to entry if you’re going to be a contributor or developer. You’ve got to find that sweet spot where things are challenging and interesting, but not so annoying that you’re like, I’m just not even going to bother. That’s basically what it comes down to. There was this client; we were trying to fix a sending mail issue. For whatever reason, the hosting wasn’t sending out the emails. So we configured this plugin to use Gmail. We looked at the steps and it was like, wait, it’s way too long. You have to go into Google Cloud and do all this. He was like, I don’t want to do this. So then we debugged it. That’s a good example. When you see that mountain of friction, you’re just like, ah. You don’t know if the payoff is going to be worth it. It makes it far less likely that you want to get involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />A potential solution to that would have been installing the SendGrid plugin and adding an API key, which would have been two steps instead of the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>mountain of steps the other way. Now Google and Yahoo have added so many sending restrictions on email. You have to be very careful about what services you’re using, making sure you have all of the DKIM things set up, all of the sender policy framework stuff set up. Otherwise, you’re not going to get through to people because Google and Yahoo now just block things that aren’t verified sources. All these things add layers of complexity to our job that weren’t there before. Google and Yahoo deciding to make a change to how email works across the entire internet affects us as developers, and sometimes it’s really hard to keep track of everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />You brought up a really great point. Why wouldn’t they just have used Alpine.js? I know that for the interactivity API in particular, the reason they didn’t was because it couldn’t do server-side rendering of directives. So they used preact instead. The thing here that we’re talking about is that WordPress as a project has gone from being just PHP with some opinionated decisions around how you build things with PHP to being PHP and JavaScript with very opinionated decisions about how you build things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />But even if it’s preact, you don’t even know that unless you dig in, right? It doesn’t use the same API; it’s its own thing. Everything is WP dash; it’s its own thing you have to learn. That’s more of what I was trying to get to with the Alpine. It’s about basically forcing a lot of non-reusable knowledge on developers. There’s nothing wrong with having non-reusable knowledge, but if you’re just constantly doing that, it makes barriers to entry. It doesn’t make it appealing; it doesn’t make it interesting to work with necessarily. On top of the whole stigma of PHP and all that stuff, it’s just you’re like, oh yeah, we just reinvented everything. We don’t even actually use HTML. I love the markup thing now. I can’t unthink it, but it’s like, oh, you thought you’d use HTML? Actually, no, this is not HTML; it’s just block markup and there’s no parallel elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />There’s also places where you do CSS on JSON files, which is also very interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Oh my God. Somebody showed me that. I was like, why? Oh my God, no, you’re right. I forgot about that. I memory-holed a lot of this stuff actually. I’m slightly traumatized and I’m just like… This comes from a person that loves learning. I’m just like, but why is this getting so complicated? I think it’s really healthy. I think part of refactoring is to take a look back and be like, okay, why is this so complicated? But I just feel like we’re constantly adding more and not taking anything back. Now it’s getting in the realm of, like we said, everything’s its own thing and it’s just WordPress. It’s not even JavaScript. I’m not a React expert, but I hear all the time from React people that even the WordPress React stuff is not typical React. So it’s really confusing for me that we’re doing this and making it so inaccessible because even a React developer can’t just be like, oh, okay, this is just standard React. It’s not, and they have to learn what the WordPress React flavor is as opposed to just everybody else’s flavor of React.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />I totally agree. We are sort of recreating every library and framework that there is, prefixing it with WP Dash, and then in the React world, just renaming the functions in the libraries we import. Nothing more than that. If you look at the source code, it’s exactly the same React source code that you have in other projects, and that doesn’t make sense. But I wanted to also suggest that we talk good things about WordPress and developing in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we have all these options and variations, and the fact that people tend to complicate quite a bit when it comes to building a simple theme or plugin. At the same time, the more seasoned experts have the opportunity to keep things simple. There is still plenty of space to solve the most common problems with just simple PHP files, with just simple CSS solutions. We can use whatever JavaScript flavor we want to solve those problems. Even though there are recommended and opinionated ways, it is still a platform that allows us to implement whatever we want to do. If you want to bring in Alpine to a project, you can. If you want to bring other product frameworks to a project, you can. You’re still very much free to do whatever you want. There are no hard restrictions. There’s no downside to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s what I think is on the positive side because it is still a ground where there’s a lot of adaptation and a lot of inclusive libraries that you can bring in and make it easier for you to work in the way that you know how to solve problems. It is still not at the point where we have to go with a certain way; otherwise, it will not work, it will not compile, it will not run on WordPress. I think WordPress and WooCommerce, for that matter as well, are still the best platforms to offer those options and offer those variations to clients and fix these problems the way that we know that they’re fixable, either by just changing a couple of PHP lines, by just doing JavaScript, or by doing a React component on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can definitely dive a little bit more into React in other episodes, but I think React, in the sense of having dynamic HTML on the front end, is fixing some of the problems that the basic HTML and PHP had back in the day and that contribute to a more performing website. Then again, everything gets complicated because of the way they were introduced, the lack of documentation, and the constant sprinting that it seems to be happening when it comes to adopting these features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, I agree. You can. I always use Roots Bedrock, so I’m always bringing in PHP libraries from elsewhere and it’s still possible to do that. I’m always thinking about accessibility. You can always bring Alpine. It takes seconds. It’s more about how do we make it more accessible? It’s a constant battle, right? It’s a constant battle of, okay, we want to be challenged. Especially more advanced developers want to feel like they’re building something. It’s fun to reinvent a wheel, but at the end of the day, you also have to maintain this for a long time. You have to be really clear about why you’re doing it because WordPress is an old project and it’s not going anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have to think about, will we want to be maintaining this in 10 years? That’s really important too. I think that’s part of the reason why they bring the libraries in, but I think it’s really important to think about why you’re doing this and the knowledge and the APIs and the ways, especially as you’re making it more developer-focused, how you expose these things to developers is really important because you don’t want to end up in a place where it’s just a really specialized skill set. Then it’s really hard to bring in people. It was already somewhat challenging to bring in advanced developers into WordPress before. It’s on my mind. But I agree. I think WordPress is always great for bringing in the tools that you want. You’re never limited to do that. If you want to do something, you can always do it. That’s really good for that. There’s never a wrong place. If you figure out you need a specific tool, there’s no reason not to bring it in. WordPress will never get in your way to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Correct. If you need a Python script to run somewhere, you can do that. You can put it into a project. If you need to bring React in a way that WordPress is not using React, you can do that. Have you guys seen the WP admin redesign and what’s happening in the future to that side that is still very much PHP-controlled of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I haven’t. I haven’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />We just got a glimpse at WordCamp Porto that happened this past weekend. Everything is going to be—well, I’m not sure if everything, but at least the things that we saw, the media library and some of the preview of media and documents and post editing—everything is going to be React-based. Everything is going to look like what you have right now in WooCommerce, the experimental page to add a product or to edit a product. It looks very stripped down, but the WP admin is going to be all about React components and JavaScript and state management and client-side computing and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we follow all the conversations we had so far and we look into the future and see WP admin and what’s coming, it’s going to get a lot more complicated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Well, exactly. It looks really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />As it should, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I just don’t know how easy it will be to extend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />It won’t. It will be the exact same challenges we have and still have with WooCommerce. It’s going to be less extensible. It’s going to be harder to figure out how to adopt things that we used to adopt. I guess the number of those famous plugins that begin with “classic something” are going to have a very good time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />So you can always turn it off, right? That’s the good thing about WordPress. You can always usually turn off the new stuff</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and keep your legacy familiar, good feeling, warm, fuzzy…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Maybe we’ll see a classic admin plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Is that what you’re saying?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />It’s definitely already created somewhere. There’s a repo with some code already being updated as new beta features come up. But what’s the whole point of it? Also, I’m asking you guys about the WP admin and we are seasoned developers. I’m pretty sure if I ask other people and most of these things that are going on and being planned and screens that we are able to see and we can actually download and play around a little bit, these are all known things to the general developer public. It would be great if we could get a glimpse of how things are. You can always go there and look and see the source code and check out the GitHub and the messages and all the issues and whatnot, but that’s a lot more difficult than if you were invited to participate in a way that they explain why certain decisions were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once it’s out and we get in contact with it, we’re going to throw our hands up and say, how the hell is this extensible? Where did my stuff go? I’m not going to adopt it. Then we’re going to fight as we fought Gutenberg for other reasons, but also for the reasons of not being able to work with it for long years. Then it’s not going to be adopted at the rate that people thought it would be adopted, but it’s going to get even crazier for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />We’ll see where it goes. I think I’ve been saying this for a couple of years, but I think it’s getting more important. I feel lots of features, very little focus on developer experience, and that’s an important thing. If you’re going to revamp completely how things work and make it more complicated, it’s worth thinking of how can we make it easier for developers to get to the point where they can do the things they want to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />We are required as PHP developers, or for the most people who have been working with WordPress since the beginning or very close to the beginning, we are definitely more and more required to learn JavaScript in a way and to use it in a way that we were using PHP until now. That is the most confusing part for me. Although I’ve gone through some of the work and some of the understanding of how the JavaScript will replace most of the front end, it is still very strange to me how I’m going to use JavaScript to perform tasks that PHP files are still doing or did in the past. How can we suddenly have to be forced to learn JavaScript in a way that it’s going to possibly hinder us from doing our jobs properly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I mean a developer’s job is already quite difficult and challenging. To add more to the plate of never-ending growing stuff doesn’t feel like the best idea. Especially when you said, imagine someone who is maintaining the future repositories, the React stuff, and you tell someone their task is to clone this other repository that already exists and then run a search and replace to prefix the functions. You’re going to question, is this a good use of my time? At least I certainly would be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Yeah, I mean I think as a developer, this is something I noticed with my friends. I am 41 now. My friends, when they got closer to their forties, they’re like, I’ve learned enough. I don’t want to learn anything new anymore. I’m like, you’re in the wrong profession buddy. To not learn anything, you should go learn some COBOL and work at a bank and then you’ll never have to learn anything else ever again. But in the world of front-end and web development, it’s always changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think, like I mentioned, it’s really confusing when you’re like, why did we reinvent the wheel here? That happened on the PHP side still. I don’t really understand why we had to invent an HTTP API. I found a serious performance bug in there a couple of years ago that I fixed. That would not have been an issue if you used Guzzle, even if you just had it namespaced. They used to do that. So it’s very hard because it’s one thing to force developers to learn new things. I think developers are constantly going to have to learn new things. I just think you should be respectful of what you’re asking them to learn. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a lot of what I think about is I love learning, but half the time I’m like, I’m going to wait as long as possible to learn something the WordPress way until I need to because I know that this is not transposable anywhere. That’s not respectful of my time as well. It’s not about just your time maintaining it; it’s your time learning. I want to learn things that I feel help me grow as a developer, not just… I’m more interested in that. If I have to do it to solve a problem, I will do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I won’t go out of my way to learn something. I think you have to be respectful of your time because there’s so much stuff to learn now. It’s getting more complex, not less. I think all of us here are full stack developers, so there’s a lot to learn out there. You have to be mindful of how you’re using your time to learn things, and I think that’s really important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with the WordPress stuff, I try to be like, okay, I will learn it one day, but I’m not going to go out of my way to learn it now. Especially actually speaking of being respectful of your time too is when the APIs aren’t stable either. You don’t want to learn something and then it’s going to change. You’re going to get the rug pulled. That doesn’t feel great either. You have to balance it out. I understand the need to modernize everything and make it client-side, but developers also have to respect their time and their skillset and make choices that make them feel like they’re learning and becoming better developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />With that said, Zach, you asked at the beginning, what are our plans in terms of subjects to bring in? I think we can sum up by saying we’ll try to demystify a little bit all of these more modern things that are coming out and give some tips and orientations. All of these new APIs that are coming out, we will eventually end up using for client work. We can share how our experience was with that and bring in other people who have been using those APIs and tools and other solutions for the problems we all have been solving for all of these years in different ways. I think that’s going to inspire other people to think differently or to add to their repertoire or just to listen to how we can contribute to adopting all of these new things that are coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Well, it’s awesome. I look forward to listening to those episodes and learning myself. If any of you who are listening have ideas for topics that you’d like to hear any of the four of us cover, we would love to hear them. Send them to Bob. Hashtag Bug Bob. We started that here. We’re going to keep it going. Hashtag Bug Bob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Hashtag bug Bob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Let him know that you have ideas for things you’d like to hear about on the Woo DevChat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />Bug him in person in Turin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />You can bug him in person during WordCamp EU. That is coming up very shortly. There will be a Do the Woo table there. There will not be a Zach there. I tried. Couldn’t make it happen this year. However, I believe, Carl, you’re going to be there. I would imagine Mike and Marcel, you’re probably both going, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />We are going, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Yeah, so I will have all the FOMO and you will have all the fun. I hope all three of you enjoy the event, but definitely hashtag Bug Bob does apply in person as well. Feel free to walk up to Bob with your ideas, no matter how crazy they are. In fact, the crazier the better. Bob loves that. We would love to hear from you with feedback on how we’re doing and the things you’d like to learn about. This podcast is for you. It’s not just for all of us to sit around and wax poetic about the things. We love that. We do enjoy doing that. We want to know what you want to learn and what you’d like to see covered or if you want to participate. We are always looking for guests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that being said, welcome Marcel and Mike to the WooDevChat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Thank you very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I think this is going to be a lot of fun. Maybe every once in a while we’ll have to change it up and join each other’s podcasts so that we can just keep people guessing who’s going to be on what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />That would be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Sounds awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />I appreciate both of you. Where can people get in touch with you other than hashtag Bug Bob?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I have my own website, WPbullet.com, which is currently being redesigned. That’s how people can get in touch with me. I’m also on LinkedIn. I’m not really that active on Twitter, but I should be. I hear it’s a lot of fun there. Or it’s X now, right? People still just call it Twitter though, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I feel it’s really quiet now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />It’s very quiet. People can get a hold of me at my website, MarcelSchmitz.com. I go by schmitzoide on all social networks. That’s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Awesome. Hopefully, you know where to find Carl and me by now, but if you don’t, I am at ZStepek pretty much everywhere. Carl?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carl:<br />I can be located on LinkedIn. I’m trying to connect with everybody there. I’m still on Twitter at TwigPress. I don’t see a lot of interactions there anymore, so I’m not that active on social media, but usually it’s all Carl Alexander. GitHub, all those places. It’s at Carl Alexander. That’s where you can find me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zach:<br />Okay, well thank you all for being here. Here’s to the future of the Woo DevChats and I hope to see you in person soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Cheers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Cheers.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>Woo DevChat</em></strong>, hosts <strong>Zach</strong> and <strong>Carl</strong> are joined by <strong>Mike</strong> and <strong>Marcel</strong>, two seasoned WooCommerce experts and new hosts to our show, to discuss the evolving landscape of WordPress and WooCommerce development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation covers a range of topics including the challenges and opportunities presented by the transition from PHP to React, the impact of monorepos on development complexity, and the essential role of soft skills in client interactions plus a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hightlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transition from Builder to Developer:</strong> There are a lot of people who can build a WooCommerce site and understand how to use WooCommerce as a plugin, but the move to how to extend and optimize WooCommerce as a developer is really kind of a big shift. I think we&#8217;ve been trying to fill that gap and help people make that transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Soft Skills in Development:</strong> I really believe that you need a lot of soft skills, especially if you’re on your own, but even in companies, I find it useful to have soft skills as a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Developer Experience with WooCommerce</strong>: PHP used to give us so much freedom that we don’t have right now with React, and I still think that there’s a lot that we can do to regain some of that freedom for changing stuff. So that’s something we can definitely talk about because we live that day to day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Future of WordPress Admin</strong>: We just got a glimpse at WordCamp Porto that happened this past weekend. Everything is going to be—well, I’m not sure if everything, but at least the things that we saw, the media library and some of the preview of media and documents and post editing—everything is going to be React-based.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New Opportunities in WooCommerce</strong>: Today we have all these options and variations, and the fact that people tend to complicate quite a bit when it comes to building a simple theme or plugin. At the same time, the more seasoned experts have the opportunity to keep things simple. There is still plenty of space to solve the most common problems with just simple PHP files, with just simple CSS solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenge of Mono Repos</strong>: If you were to ask that question to me maybe one or two years ago, I would ask you back, “What is a monorepo?” WooCommerce taught me what a monorepo was because I’d heard about it, but I’d never seen it in practice. I immediately jumped out of it. Back in the day, you could just clone the repository, build it yourself, do a couple of experiments to figure out what things are under the hood and what happens if you change that code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of Developer Accessibility</strong>: You brought up the interactivity API. Very interesting stuff. I hope that maybe at some point we get the cart fragment replaced with an interactivity API-based one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maintaining a Developer-Friendly Environment</strong>: It’s more about how do we make it more accessible? It’s a constant battle, right? It’s a constant battle of, okay, we want to be challenged. Especially more advanced developers want to feel like they’re building something. It’s fun to reinvent a wheel, but at the end of the day, you also have to maintain this for a long time. You have to be really clear about why you’re doing it because WordPress is an old project and it’s not going anywhere.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Jun 2024 08:27:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"Matt: Melt Your Butter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=114712\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://ma.tt/2024/06/melt-your-butter/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1896:\"<p>In my life I like to experience things high/low, to stay grounded. So while I&#8217;ve been taken on culinary adventures with the best chefs in the world like <a href=\"https://noma.dk/\">René Redzepi</a> or <a href=\"https://www.singlethreadfarms.com/\">Kyle Connaughton</a>, sometimes I find myself on a United flight, as I am today, ordering the chicken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you move between two extremes it&#8217;s not the big things that bother you, for example I&#8217;m sure this <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/dining/in-pursuit-of-tastier-chickens-a-strict-diet-of-four-star-scraps.html\">chicken wasn&#8217;t raised on scraps from Michelin star restaurants</a>, as I was once told in New York, but the little things, like &#8220;Why is this butter as hard as a rock?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Butter, one of the most magical of ingredients, should spread. Yet it is served in so many places at a temperature that makes you feel more like you&#8217;re carving Play-doh. So I will now give you one of my favorite travel hacks: On United they nuke the main entree too hot to eat when it arrives, but this is now to your advantage because you can open the small butter tin and put it on the scorched entree and let thermodynamics turn it from rock-hard butter-ice to supple, delicious butter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process takes a minute or two, just enough time to eat your salad (be careful opening the pressurized balsamic dressing!) and allow the bread to cool a bit and be palatable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On occasion I have left the butter in the heat too long, and it liquifies, but then I just use it as a pour or dip my bread into it, imagining myself at <a href=\"https://peterluger.com/\">Peter Luger&#8217;s</a> dipping my steak into the collected deliciousness at the bottom of the dish. If you&#8217;re serving at home, softening the butter and warming plates is an easy way to elevate your game.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Jun 2024 00:57:45

Jeg gik på Syddansk Erhvervsskole i Odense på hovedforløbet som webintegrator. Jeg har taget grundforløbet som mediegrafiker i Kolding, men jeg stoppede, fordi jeg havde mistet min interesse for det. Så begyndte jeg på grundforløbet som webintegrator, da jeg elsker at lave hjemmesider.\r\n\r\nNoget af min fritid bruger jeg på at cykle, da jeg elsker at få set mig omkring og ikke mindst at få en masse frisk luft efter at have siddet ved en computer hele dagen. Jeg har cyklet mange tusinde kilometer rundt omkring i Danmark, og et par kilometer i Tyskland, og taget nogle billeder, som du kan se <a href=\"http://kennethclemmensen.test/billeder\">her</a>. Udover at cykle bruger jeg også lidt af min fritid på at se forskellige tv-serier. Blandt andet Friends, Krøniken, Rejseholdet og Hotellet. Et par timers bowling bliver det også til en gang imellem.','Om mig','','inherit','closed','closed','','35-revision-v1','','','2017-06-10 17:43:00','2017-06-10 15:43:00','',35,'http://kennethclemmensen.test/2017/06/10/35-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1594,1,'2017-09-14 19:37:39','2017-09-14 17:37:39','Turen til Fyn viser billeder fra min cykeltur fra Kolding til Middelfart den 24. september 2008.\r\n\r\n<video controls=\"controls\" controlsList=\"nodownload\">\r\n<source src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/turen_til_fyn.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n<source src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/turen_til_fyn.ogv\" type=\"video/ogv\" />\r\n</video>','Film','','inherit','closed','closed','','27-revision-v1','','','2017-09-14 19:37:39','2017-09-14 17:37:39','',27,'http://kennethclemmensen.test/2017/09/14/27-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1600,1,'2017-10-25 12:33:27','2017-10-25 10:33:27','','polylang_mo_6','','private','closed','closed','','polylang_mo_6','','','2017-10-25 12:33:27','2017-10-25 10:33:27','',0,'http://kennethclemmensen.test/?post_type=polylang_mo&p=1600',0,'polylang_mo','',0),(1643,1,'2018-03-05 19:46:48','2018-03-05 18:46:48','','favicon','','inherit','open','closed','','favicon','','','2018-03-05 19:46:48','2018-03-05 18:46:48','',0,'http://kennethclemmensen.test/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/favicon.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(1644,1,'2018-03-05 19:46:52','2018-03-05 18:46:52','http://kennethclemmensen.test/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-favicon.png','cropped-favicon.png','','inherit','open','closed','','cropped-favicon-png','','','2018-03-05 19:46:52','2018-03-05 18:46:52','',0,'http://kennethclemmensen.test/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-favicon.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(1647,1,'2018-03-10 07:47:28','2018-03-10 06:47:28','','Over Holluf','','inherit','closed','closed','','1503-autosave-v1','','','2018-03-10 07:47:28','2018-03-10 06:47:28','',1503,'http://kennethclemmensen.test/2018/03/10/1503-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1648,1,'2018-03-10 07:48:35','2018-03-10 06:48:35','','Skov ved','','inherit','closed','closed','','1501-autosave-v1','','','2018-03-10 07:48:35','2018-03-10 06:48:35','',1501,'http://kennethclemmensen.test/2018/03/10/1501-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1649,1,'2018-03-10 07:49:35','2018-03-10 06:49:35','','Lillebæ','','inherit','closed','closed','','1499-autosave-v1','','','2018-03-10 07:49:35','2018-03-10 06:49:35','',1499,'http://kennethclemmensen.test/2018/03/10/1499-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1650,1,'2018-03-10 07:53:39','2018-03-10 06:53:39','','Kerteminde','','inherit','closed','closed','','1495-autosave-v1','','','2018-03-10 07:53:39','2018-03-10 06:53:39','',1495,'http://kennethclemmensen.test/2018/03/10/1495-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1651,1,'2018-03-10 07:55:01','2018-03-10 06:55:01','','Blangstedgård','','inherit','closed','closed','','1506-autosave-v1','','','2018-03-10 07:55:01','2018-03-10 06:55:01','',1506,'http://kennethclemmensen.test/2018/03/10/1506-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1664,1,'2018-08-30 16:57:37','2018-08-30 14:57:37','<p>Her har jeg samlet links til sider, som jeg har lavet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\'/links/andre\'>Andre</a>\r\nI denne kategori er der links til sider, som jeg har lavet for andre.</p>','Links','','inherit','closed','closed','','33-revision-v1','','','2018-08-30 16:57:37','2018-08-30 14:57:37','',33,'http://kennethclemmensen.test/2018/08/30/33-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1693,1,'2018-11-20 20:09:58','2018-11-20 19:09:58','På denne side er der forskellige gallerier med en masse billeder i.
